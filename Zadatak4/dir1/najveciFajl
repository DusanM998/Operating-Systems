NAME
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).  Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --all
              do not ignore entries starting with .

       -A, --almost-all
              do not list implied . and ..

       --author
              with -l, print the author of each file

       -b, --escape
              print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters

       --block-size=SIZE
              with -l, scale sizes by SIZE when printing them; e.g., '--block-size=M'; see SIZE format below

       -B, --ignore-backups
              do not list implied entries ending with ~

       -c     with  -lt:  sort  by, and show, ctime (time of last modification of file status information); with -l: show ctime and sort by name; otherwise:
              sort by ctime, newest first

       -C     list entries by columns

       --color[=WHEN]
              colorize the output; WHEN can be 'always' (default if omitted), 'auto', or 'never'; more info below

       -d, --directory
              list directories themselves, not their contents

       -D, --dired
              generate output designed for Emacs' dired mode

       -f     do not sort, enable -aU, disable -ls --color

       -F, --classify
              append indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries

       --file-type
              likewise, except do not append '*'

       --format=WORD
              across -x, commas -m, horizontal -x, long -l, single-column -1, verbose -l, vertical -C

       --full-time
              like -l --time-style=full-iso

       -g     like -l, but do not list owner

       --group-directories-first
              group directories before files;

              can be augmented with a --sort option, but any use of --sort=none (-U) disables grouping

       -G, --no-group
              in a long listing, don't print group names

       -h, --human-readable
              with -l and -s, print sizes like 1K 234M 2G etc.

       --si   likewise, but use powers of 1000 not 1024

       -k, --kibibytes
              default to 1024-byte blocks for disk usage; used only with -s and per directory totals

       -l     use a long listing format

       -L, --dereference
              when showing file information for a symbolic link, show information for the file the link references rather than for the link itself

       -m     fill width with a comma separated list of entries

       -n, --numeric-uid-gid
              like -l, but list numeric user and group IDs

       -p, --indicator-style=slash
              append / indicator to directories

       -q, --hide-control-chars
              print ? instead of nongraphic characters

       --show-control-chars
              show nongraphic characters as-is (the default, unless program is 'ls' and output is a terminal)

       -Q, --quote-name
              enclose entry names in double quotes

       --quoting-style=WORD
              use quoting style WORD for entry names: literal, locale, shell, shell-always, shell-escape, shell-escape-always, c,  escape  (overrides  QUOT‐
              ING_STYLE environment variable)

       -r, --reverse
              reverse order while sorting

       -R, --recursive
              list subdirectories recursively

       -s, --size
              print the allocated size of each file, in blocks

       -S     sort by file size, largest first

       --sort=WORD
              sort by WORD instead of name: none (-U), size (-S), time (-t), version (-v), extension (-X)

       --time=WORD
              with -l, show time as WORD instead of default modification time: atime or access or use (-u); ctime or status (-c); also use specified time as
              sort key if --sort=time (newest first)

       --time-style=TIME_STYLE
              time/date format with -l; see TIME_STYLE below

       -t     sort by modification time, newest first

       -T, --tabsize=COLS
              assume tab stops at each COLS instead of 8

       -u     with -lt: sort by, and show, access time; with -l: show access time and sort by name; otherwise: sort by access time, newest first

       -U     do not sort; list entries in directory order

       -v     natural sort of (version) numbers within text

       -w, --width=COLS
              set output width to COLS.  0 means no limit

       -x     list entries by lines instead of by columns

       -X     sort alphabetically by entry extension

       -Z, --context
              print any security context of each file

       -1     list one file per line.  Avoid '\n' with -q or -b

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).  Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y (powers of  1024)  or  KB,MB,...  (powers  of
       1000).

       The  TIME_STYLE  argument  can  be  full-iso,  long-iso,  iso, locale, or +FORMAT.  FORMAT is interpreted like in date(1).  If FORMAT is FORMAT1<new‐
       line>FORMAT2, then FORMAT1 applies to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files.  TIME_STYLE prefixed with 'posix-' takes effect only outside  the
       POSIX locale.  Also the TIME_STYLE environment variable sets the default style to use.

       Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and with --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when standard
       output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.

   Exit status:
       0      if OK,

       1      if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),

       2      if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

NAME
       man - an interface to the system reference manuals

SYNOPSIS
       man [man options] [[section] page ...] ...
       man -k [apropos options] regexp ...
       man -K [man options] [section] term ...
       man -f [whatis options] page ...
       man -l [man options] file ...
       man -w|-W [man options] page ...

DESCRIPTION
       man  is  the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associ‐
       ated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of  the  manual.
       The default action is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found,
       even if page exists in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE, ERRORS, ENVIRONMENT,  FILES,  VER‐
       SIONS, CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact  rendering  may  vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render italics when running in a terminal,
       and will typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable  to  illustrate  several
       exclusive invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

       man man.7
           Display the manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is an alternative spelling of "man 7 man".)

       man 'man(7)'
           Display  the  manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is another alternative spelling of "man 7 man".  It may be more convenient
           when copying and pasting cross-references to manual pages.  Note that the parentheses must normally be quoted to protect them from the shell.)

       man -a intro
           Display, in succession, all of the available intro manual pages contained within the manual.  It is possible to quit between successive  displays
           or skip any of them.

       man -t bash | lpr -Pps
           Format the manual page for bash into the default troff or groff format and pipe it to the printer named ps.  The default output for groff is usu‐
           ally PostScript.  man --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.

       man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a device independent (dvi) file.  The redirection is neces‐
           sary as the -T flag causes output to be directed to stdout with no pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi or further pro‐
           cessed into PostScript using a program such as dvips.

       man -k printf
           Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.  Print out any matches.   Equivalent  to  apro‐
           pos printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short descriptions of any found.  Equivalent to whatis smail.

OVERVIEW
       Many  options are available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes can be made to the search path, section or‐
       der, output processor, and other behaviours and operations detailed below.

       If set, various environment variables are interrogated to determine the operation of man.  It is possible to set the "catch-all" variable $MANOPT  to
       any string in command line format, with the exception that any spaces used as part of an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).
       man will parse $MANOPT prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options requiring an argument will be overridden by the same  options  found  on
       the  command line.  To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be specified as the initial command line option.  This will allow man to "for‐
       get" about the options specified in $MANOPT, although they must still have been valid.

       Manual pages are normally stored in nroff(1) format under a directory such as /usr/share/man.  In some installations, there may also be  preformatted
       cat pages to improve performance.  See manpath(5) for details of where these files are stored.

       This  package supports manual pages in multiple languages, controlled by your locale.  If your system did not set this up for you automatically, then
       you may need to set $LC_MESSAGES, $LANG, or another system-dependent environment variable to indicate your preferred locale, usually specified in the
       POSIX format:

       <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your locale, it will be displayed in lieu of the standard (usually American English) page.

       If you find that the translations supplied with this package are not available in your native language and you would like to supply them, please con‐
       tact the maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.

       Individual manual pages are normally written and maintained by the maintainers of the program, function, or other topic that they document,  and  are
       not  included  with  this  package.  If you find that a manual page is missing or inadequate, please report that to the maintainers of the package in
       question.

       For information regarding other features and extensions available with this manual pager, please read the documents supplied with the package.

DEFAULTS
       The order of sections to search may be overridden by the environment variable $MANSECT or by the SECTION directive in  /etc/manpath.config.   By  de‐
       fault it is as follows:

              1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7

       The  formatted manual page is displayed using a pager.  This can be specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default (see option -P
       for details).

       The filters are deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line option -p or the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is interrogated.  If -p
       was  not  used  and the environment variable was not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain a valid
       preprocessor string, the first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A formatting pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable
       program  mandb_nfmt  (or  mandb_tfmt  with  -t) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets passed the manual source file, the pre‐
       processor string, and optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non-argument options that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both, are not harmful.  For options  that  require  an  argument,
       each duplication will override the previous argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
              This option is normally issued as the very first option and resets man's behaviour to its default.  Its use is to reset those options that may
              have been set in $MANOPT.  Any options that follow -D will have their usual effect.

       --warnings[=warnings]
              Enable warnings from groff.  This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of manual pages.  warnings is a comma-separated list
              of warning names; if it is not supplied, the default is "mac".  See the “Warnings” node in info groff for a list of available warning names.

   Main modes of operation
       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent to whatis.  Display a short description from the manual page, if available.  See whatis(1) for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1) for details.

       -K, --global-apropos
              Search  for text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time; if you can, you should specify a section
              to reduce the number of pages that need to be searched.  Search terms may be simple strings (the  default),  or  regular  expressions  if  the
              --regex option is used.

              Note that this searches the sources of the manual pages, not the rendered text, and so may include false positives due to things like comments
              in source files.  Searching the rendered text would be much slower.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate "local" mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching through the system's manual collection.  Each  manual  page
              argument  will  be  interpreted as an nroff source file in the correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the argu‐
              ments, input will be taken from stdin.  When this option is not used, and man fails to find the page required,  before  displaying  the  error
              message, it attempts to act as if this option was supplied, using the name as a filename and looking for an exact match.

       -w, --where, --path, --location
              Don't  actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the source nroff file that would be formatted.  If the -a option is also
              used, then print the locations of all source files that match the search criteria.

       -W, --where-cat, --location-cat
              Don't actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the preformatted cat file that would be displayed.  If the -a  option  is
              also used, then print the locations of all preformatted cat files that match the search criteria.

              If  -w  and  -W are both used, then print both source file and cat file separated by a space.  If all of -w, -W, and -a are used, then do this
              for each possible match.

       -c, --catman
              This option is not for general use and should only be used by the catman program.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead of formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the specified encoding.  If you already know the encod‐
              ing of the source file, you can also use manconv(1) directly.  However, this option allows you to convert several manual pages to a single en‐
              coding without having to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they were already installed in a structure similar to  a  manual
              page hierarchy.

              Consider  using  man-recode(1) instead for converting multiple manual pages, since it has an interface designed for bulk conversion and so can
              be much faster.

   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              man will normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which  interrogates  various  environment  variables,
              possibly  including  $LC_MESSAGES and $LANG.  To temporarily override the determined value, use this option to supply a locale string directly
              to man.  Note that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such as the help message will  always  be  dis‐
              played in the initially determined locale.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If  this system has access to other operating system's manual pages, they can be accessed using this option.  To search for a manual page from
              NewOS's manual page collection, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include a search of  the  native  operating  system's
              manual pages, include the system name man in the argument string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify  an  alternate  manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath derived code to determine the path to search.  This option overrides the
              $MANPATH environment variable and causes option -m to be ignored.

              A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into sections as described in the  man-db  manual  (under
              "The manual page system").  To view manual pages outside such hierarchies, see the -l option.

       -S list, -s list, --sections=list
              The given list is a colon- or comma-separated list of sections, used to determine which manual sections to search and in what order.  This op‐
              tion overrides the $MANSECT environment variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility with System V.)

       -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension
              Some systems incorporate large packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the Tcl package, into the main  manual  page  hierarchy.
              To get around the problem of having two manual pages with the same name such as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to section l.
              As this is unfortunate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and to assign a specific  "extension"  to  them,  in  this
              case,  exit(3tcl).   Under  normal  operation, man will display exit(3) in preference to exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and to avoid
              having to know which section the page you require resides in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string indicating  which  package
              the page must belong to.  Using the above example, supplying the option -e tcl to man will restrict the search to pages having an extension of
              *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       --regex
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument as a regular expression,  as  with  apro‐
              pos(1).  Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a regular expression, this option implies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show  all  pages  with  any  part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument using shell-style wildcards, as with
              apropos(1) --wildcard.  The page argument must match the entire name or description, or match on word boundaries in  the  description.   Since
              there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a wildcard, this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If the --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names, not page descriptions, as with whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By  default,  man  will  exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.  Using this option forces man to display all the manual
              pages with names that match the search criteria.

       -u, --update
              This option causes man to update its database caches of installed manual pages.  This is only needed in rare situations, and  it  is  normally
              better to run mandb(8) instead.

       --no-subpages
              By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the command line as equivalent to a single manual page name contain‐
              ing a hyphen or an underscore.  This supports the common pattern of programs that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to  provide
              manual pages for each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to invoke the subcommands themselves.  For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify  which  output pager to use.  By default, man uses pager, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.  This option
              overrides the $MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is not used in conjunction with  -f
              or -k.

              The  value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).
              It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an ar‐
              gument or on standard input.

       -r prompt, --prompt=prompt
              If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to set its prompt and some sensible options.  The default prompt looks like

               Manual page name(sec) line x

              where  name denotes the manual page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x the current line number.  This is achieved by using
              the $LESS environment variable.

              Supplying -r with a string will override this default.  The string may contain the text $MAN_PN which will be expanded to the name of the cur‐
              rent manual page and its section name surrounded by "(" and ")".  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              \ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:
              byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..
              (press h for help or q to quit)

              It is broken into three lines here for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the less(1) manual page.  The prompt string is first
              evaluated by the shell.  All double quotes, back-quotes and backslashes in the prompt must be escaped by a preceding  backslash.   The  prompt
              string may end in an escaped $ which may be followed by further options for less.  By default man sets the -ix8 options.

              The $MANLESS environment variable described below may be used to set a default prompt string if none is supplied on the command line.

       -7, --ascii
              When  viewing  a  pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may not display correctly when using the
              latin1(7) device description with GNU nroff.  This option allows pure ascii manual pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1 device.   It
              will  not  translate  any  latin1 text.  The following table shows the translations performed: some parts of it may only be displayed properly
              when using GNU nroff's latin1(7) device.

              Description           Octal   latin1   ascii
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────
              continuation hyphen    255      ‐        -
              bullet (middle dot)    267      •        o
              acute accent           264      ´        '
              multiplication sign    327      ×        x

              If the latin1 column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters and this option is not necessary.   If  the  latin1
              and  ascii columns are identical, you are reading this page using this option or man did not format this page using the latin1 device descrip‐
              tion.  If the latin1 column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual pages with this option.

              This option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for nroff other than GNU's.

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward compatibility, encoding may be an nroff device such  as  ascii,
              latin1, or utf8 as well as a true character encoding such as UTF-8.

       --no-hyphenation, --nh
              Normally, nroff will automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not contain hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to lay
              out words on a line without excessive spacing.  This option disables automatic hyphenation, so words will only be hyphenated if  they  already
              contain hyphens.

              If  you  are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at an inappropriate point, do not use this option,
              but consult the nroff documentation instead; for instance, you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at that point,
              or put "\%" at the start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.

       --no-justification, --nj
              Normally,  nroff will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full justification, leaving justified only to the left
              margin, sometimes called "ragged-right" text.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain paragraphs, do not use this option, but consult  the
              nroff  documentation instead; for instance, you can use the ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting and fill‐
              ing.

       -p string, --preprocessor=string
              Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff/groff.  Not all installations will have a full set of preprocessors.   Some
              of  the  preprocessors  and  the  letters used to designate them are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer (r).  This option
              overrides the $MANROFFSEQ environment variable.  zsoelim is always run as the very first preprocessor.

       -t, --troff
              Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This option is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to be suitable for a device other than the default.  It implies -t.  Examples
              (provided with Groff-1.17) include dvi, latin1, ps, utf8, X75 and X100.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This  option  will  cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web browser.  The choice of browser is determined by
              the optional browser argument if one is provided, by the $BROWSER environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually
              lynx).  This option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.

       -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]
              This option displays the output of groff in a graphical window using the gxditview program.  The dpi (dots per inch) may be 75, 75-12, 100, or
              100-12, defaulting to 75; the -12 variants use a 12-point base font.  This option implies -T with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device re‐
              spectively.

       -Z, --ditroff
              groff  will run troff and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for the chosen device.  If groff -mandoc is groff,
              this option is passed to groff and will suppress the use of a post-processor.  It implies -t.

   Getting help
       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

       MANROFFOPT
              Every time man invokes the formatter (nroff, troff, or groff), it adds the contents of $MANROFFOPT to the formatter's command line.

       MANROFFSEQ
              If $MANROFFSEQ is set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors to pass each manual page  through.   The  default  preprocessor
              list is system dependent.

       MANSECT
              If  $MANSECT  is  set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and it is used to determine which manual sections to search and in what
              order.  The default is "1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7", unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              If $MANPAGER or $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its value is used as the name of the program used to display the manual page.
              By default, pager is used, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.

              The  value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).
              It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an ar‐
              gument or on standard input.

       MANLESS
              If  $MANLESS  is set, its value will be used as the default prompt string for the less pager, as if it had been passed using the -r option (so
              any occurrences of the text $MAN_PN will be expanded in the same way).  For example, if you want to set the prompt string  unconditionally  to
              “my prompt string”, set $MANLESS to ‘-Psmy prompt string’.  Using the -r option overrides this environment variable.

       BROWSER
              If  $BROWSER  is  set,  its  value  is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a web browser for man
              --html.  In each command, %s is replaced by a filename containing the HTML output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and
              %c is replaced by a colon (:).

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m option.

       MANOPT If  $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to be in a similar format.  As all of the other man specific
              environment variables can be expressed as command line options, and are thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is expected that they
              will become obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that should be interpreted as part of an option's argument must be escaped.

       MANWIDTH
              If  $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be formatted.  If it is not set, manual pages will be
              formatted with a line length appropriate to the current terminal (using the value of $COLUMNS, and ioctl(2) if available, or falling  back  to
              80  characters if neither is available).  Cat pages will only be saved when the default formatting can be used, that is when the terminal line
              length is between 66 and 80 characters.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              Normally, when output is not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are discarded to make it easier
              to read the result without special tools.  However, if $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING is set to any non-empty value, these formatting characters are re‐
              tained.  This may be useful for wrappers around man that can interpret formatting characters.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              Normally, when output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a pager), any error output from the command used to produce  formatted  ver‐
              sions of manual pages is discarded to avoid interfering with the pager's display.  Programs such as groff often produce relatively minor error
              messages about typographical problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally confusing when displayed along with the manual
              page.   However,  some users want to see them anyway, so, if $MAN_KEEP_STDERR is set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed as
              usual.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              Depending on system and implementation, either or both of $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated for the  current  message  locale.   man
              will display its messages in that locale (if available).  See setlocale(3) for precise details.

FILES
       /etc/manpath.config
              man-db configuration file.

       /usr/share/man

NAME
       man - an interface to the system reference manuals

SYNOPSIS
       man [man options] [[section] page ...] ...
       man -k [apropos options] regexp ...
       man -K [man options] [section] term ...
       man -f [whatis options] page ...
       man -l [man options] file ...
       man -w|-W [man options] page ...

DESCRIPTION
       man  is  the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associ‐
       ated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of  the  manual.
       The default action is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found,
       even if page exists in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE, ERRORS, ENVIRONMENT,  FILES,  VER‐
       SIONS, CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact  rendering  may  vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render italics when running in a terminal,
       and will typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable  to  illustrate  several
       exclusive invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

       man man.7
           Display the manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is an alternative spelling of "man 7 man".)

       man 'man(7)'
           Display  the  manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is another alternative spelling of "man 7 man".  It may be more convenient
           when copying and pasting cross-references to manual pages.  Note that the parentheses must normally be quoted to protect them from the shell.)

       man -a intro
           Display, in succession, all of the available intro manual pages contained within the manual.  It is possible to quit between successive  displays
           or skip any of them.

       man -t bash | lpr -Pps
           Format the manual page for bash into the default troff or groff format and pipe it to the printer named ps.  The default output for groff is usu‐
           ally PostScript.  man --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.

       man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a device independent (dvi) file.  The redirection is neces‐
           sary as the -T flag causes output to be directed to stdout with no pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi or further pro‐
           cessed into PostScript using a program such as dvips.

       man -k printf
           Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.  Print out any matches.   Equivalent  to  apro‐
           pos printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short descriptions of any found.  Equivalent to whatis smail.

OVERVIEW
       Many  options are available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes can be made to the search path, section or‐
       der, output processor, and other behaviours and operations detailed below.

       If set, various environment variables are interrogated to determine the operation of man.  It is possible to set the "catch-all" variable $MANOPT  to
       any string in command line format, with the exception that any spaces used as part of an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).
       man will parse $MANOPT prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options requiring an argument will be overridden by the same  options  found  on
       the  command line.  To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be specified as the initial command line option.  This will allow man to "for‐
       get" about the options specified in $MANOPT, although they must still have been valid.

       Manual pages are normally stored in nroff(1) format under a directory such as /usr/share/man.  In some installations, there may also be  preformatted
       cat pages to improve performance.  See manpath(5) for details of where these files are stored.

       This  package supports manual pages in multiple languages, controlled by your locale.  If your system did not set this up for you automatically, then
       you may need to set $LC_MESSAGES, $LANG, or another system-dependent environment variable to indicate your preferred locale, usually specified in the
       POSIX format:

       <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your locale, it will be displayed in lieu of the standard (usually American English) page.

       If you find that the translations supplied with this package are not available in your native language and you would like to supply them, please con‐
       tact the maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.

       Individual manual pages are normally written and maintained by the maintainers of the program, function, or other topic that they document,  and  are
       not  included  with  this  package.  If you find that a manual page is missing or inadequate, please report that to the maintainers of the package in
       question.

       For information regarding other features and extensions available with this manual pager, please read the documents supplied with the package.

DEFAULTS
       The order of sections to search may be overridden by the environment variable $MANSECT or by the SECTION directive in  /etc/manpath.config.   By  de‐
       fault it is as follows:

              1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7

       The  formatted manual page is displayed using a pager.  This can be specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default (see option -P
       for details).

       The filters are deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line option -p or the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is interrogated.  If -p
       was  not  used  and the environment variable was not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain a valid
       preprocessor string, the first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A formatting pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable
       program  mandb_nfmt  (or  mandb_tfmt  with  -t) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets passed the manual source file, the pre‐
       processor string, and optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non-argument options that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both, are not harmful.  For options  that  require  an  argument,
       each duplication will override the previous argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
              This option is normally issued as the very first option and resets man's behaviour to its default.  Its use is to reset those options that may
              have been set in $MANOPT.  Any options that follow -D will have their usual effect.

       --warnings[=warnings]
              Enable warnings from groff.  This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of manual pages.  warnings is a comma-separated list
              of warning names; if it is not supplied, the default is "mac".  See the “Warnings” node in info groff for a list of available warning names.

   Main modes of operation
       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent to whatis.  Display a short description from the manual page, if available.  See whatis(1) for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1) for details.

       -K, --global-apropos
              Search  for text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time; if you can, you should specify a section
              to reduce the number of pages that need to be searched.  Search terms may be simple strings (the  default),  or  regular  expressions  if  the
              --regex option is used.

              Note that this searches the sources of the manual pages, not the rendered text, and so may include false positives due to things like comments
              in source files.  Searching the rendered text would be much slower.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate "local" mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching through the system's manual collection.  Each  manual  page
              argument  will  be  interpreted as an nroff source file in the correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the argu‐
              ments, input will be taken from stdin.  When this option is not used, and man fails to find the page required,  before  displaying  the  error
              message, it attempts to act as if this option was supplied, using the name as a filename and looking for an exact match.

       -w, --where, --path, --location
              Don't  actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the source nroff file that would be formatted.  If the -a option is also
              used, then print the locations of all source files that match the search criteria.

       -W, --where-cat, --location-cat
              Don't actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the preformatted cat file that would be displayed.  If the -a  option  is
              also used, then print the locations of all preformatted cat files that match the search criteria.

              If  -w  and  -W are both used, then print both source file and cat file separated by a space.  If all of -w, -W, and -a are used, then do this
              for each possible match.

       -c, --catman
              This option is not for general use and should only be used by the catman program.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead of formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the specified encoding.  If you already know the encod‐
              ing of the source file, you can also use manconv(1) directly.  However, this option allows you to convert several manual pages to a single en‐
              coding without having to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they were already installed in a structure similar to  a  manual
              page hierarchy.

              Consider  using  man-recode(1) instead for converting multiple manual pages, since it has an interface designed for bulk conversion and so can
              be much faster.

   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              man will normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which  interrogates  various  environment  variables,
              possibly  including  $LC_MESSAGES and $LANG.  To temporarily override the determined value, use this option to supply a locale string directly
              to man.  Note that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such as the help message will  always  be  dis‐
              played in the initially determined locale.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If  this system has access to other operating system's manual pages, they can be accessed using this option.  To search for a manual page from
              NewOS's manual page collection, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include a search of  the  native  operating  system's
              manual pages, include the system name man in the argument string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify  an  alternate  manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath derived code to determine the path to search.  This option overrides the
              $MANPATH environment variable and causes option -m to be ignored.

              A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into sections as described in the  man-db  manual  (under
              "The manual page system").  To view manual pages outside such hierarchies, see the -l option.

       -S list, -s list, --sections=list
              The given list is a colon- or comma-separated list of sections, used to determine which manual sections to search and in what order.  This op‐
              tion overrides the $MANSECT environment variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility with System V.)

       -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension
              Some systems incorporate large packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the Tcl package, into the main  manual  page  hierarchy.
              To get around the problem of having two manual pages with the same name such as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to section l.
              As this is unfortunate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and to assign a specific  "extension"  to  them,  in  this
              case,  exit(3tcl).   Under  normal  operation, man will display exit(3) in preference to exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and to avoid
              having to know which section the page you require resides in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string indicating  which  package
              the page must belong to.  Using the above example, supplying the option -e tcl to man will restrict the search to pages having an extension of
              *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       --regex
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument as a regular expression,  as  with  apro‐
              pos(1).  Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a regular expression, this option implies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show  all  pages  with  any  part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument using shell-style wildcards, as with
              apropos(1) --wildcard.  The page argument must match the entire name or description, or match on word boundaries in  the  description.   Since
              there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a wildcard, this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If the --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names, not page descriptions, as with whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By  default,  man  will  exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.  Using this option forces man to display all the manual
              pages with names that match the search criteria.

       -u, --update
              This option causes man to update its database caches of installed manual pages.  This is only needed in rare situations, and  it  is  normally
              better to run mandb(8) instead.

       --no-subpages
              By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the command line as equivalent to a single manual page name contain‐
              ing a hyphen or an underscore.  This supports the common pattern of programs that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to  provide
              manual pages for each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to invoke the subcommands themselves.  For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify  which  output pager to use.  By default, man uses pager, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.  This option
              overrides the $MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is not used in conjunction with  -f
              or -k.

              The  value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).
              It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an ar‐
              gument or on standard input.

       -r prompt, --prompt=prompt
              If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to set its prompt and some sensible options.  The default prompt looks like

               Manual page name(sec) line x

              where  name denotes the manual page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x the current line number.  This is achieved by using
              the $LESS environment variable.

              Supplying -r with a string will override this default.  The string may contain the text $MAN_PN which will be expanded to the name of the cur‐
              rent manual page and its section name surrounded by "(" and ")".  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              \ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:
              byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..
              (press h for help or q to quit)

              It is broken into three lines here for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the less(1) manual page.  The prompt string is first
              evaluated by the shell.  All double quotes, back-quotes and backslashes in the prompt must be escaped by a preceding  backslash.   The  prompt
              string may end in an escaped $ which may be followed by further options for less.  By default man sets the -ix8 options.

              The $MANLESS environment variable described below may be used to set a default prompt string if none is supplied on the command line.

       -7, --ascii
              When  viewing  a  pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may not display correctly when using the
              latin1(7) device description with GNU nroff.  This option allows pure ascii manual pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1 device.   It
              will  not  translate  any  latin1 text.  The following table shows the translations performed: some parts of it may only be displayed properly
              when using GNU nroff's latin1(7) device.

              Description           Octal   latin1   ascii
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────
              continuation hyphen    255      ‐        -
              bullet (middle dot)    267      •        o
              acute accent           264      ´        '
              multiplication sign    327      ×        x

              If the latin1 column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters and this option is not necessary.   If  the  latin1
              and  ascii columns are identical, you are reading this page using this option or man did not format this page using the latin1 device descrip‐
              tion.  If the latin1 column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual pages with this option.

              This option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for nroff other than GNU's.

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward compatibility, encoding may be an nroff device such  as  ascii,
              latin1, or utf8 as well as a true character encoding such as UTF-8.

       --no-hyphenation, --nh
              Normally, nroff will automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not contain hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to lay
              out words on a line without excessive spacing.  This option disables automatic hyphenation, so words will only be hyphenated if  they  already
              contain hyphens.

              If  you  are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at an inappropriate point, do not use this option,
              but consult the nroff documentation instead; for instance, you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at that point,
              or put "\%" at the start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.

       --no-justification, --nj
              Normally,  nroff will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full justification, leaving justified only to the left
              margin, sometimes called "ragged-right" text.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain paragraphs, do not use this option, but consult  the
              nroff  documentation instead; for instance, you can use the ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting and fill‐
              ing.

       -p string, --preprocessor=string
              Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff/groff.  Not all installations will have a full set of preprocessors.   Some
              of  the  preprocessors  and  the  letters used to designate them are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer (r).  This option
              overrides the $MANROFFSEQ environment variable.  zsoelim is always run as the very first preprocessor.

       -t, --troff
              Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This option is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to be suitable for a device other than the default.  It implies -t.  Examples
              (provided with Groff-1.17) include dvi, latin1, ps, utf8, X75 and X100.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This  option  will  cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web browser.  The choice of browser is determined by
              the optional browser argument if one is provided, by the $BROWSER environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually
              lynx).  This option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.

       -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]
              This option displays the output of groff in a graphical window using the gxditview program.  The dpi (dots per inch) may be 75, 75-12, 100, or
              100-12, defaulting to 75; the -12 variants use a 12-point base font.  This option implies -T with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device re‐
              spectively.

       -Z, --ditroff
              groff  will run troff and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for the chosen device.  If groff -mandoc is groff,
              this option is passed to groff and will suppress the use of a post-processor.  It implies -t.

   Getting help
       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

       MANROFFOPT
              Every time man invokes the formatter (nroff, troff, or groff), it adds the contents of $MANROFFOPT to the formatter's command line.

       MANROFFSEQ
              If $MANROFFSEQ is set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors to pass each manual page  through.   The  default  preprocessor
              list is system dependent.

       MANSECT
              If  $MANSECT  is  set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and it is used to determine which manual sections to search and in what
              order.  The default is "1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7", unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              If $MANPAGER or $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its value is used as the name of the program used to display the manual page.
              By default, pager is used, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.

              The  value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).
              It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an ar‐
              gument or on standard input.

       MANLESS
              If  $MANLESS  is set, its value will be used as the default prompt string for the less pager, as if it had been passed using the -r option (so
              any occurrences of the text $MAN_PN will be expanded in the same way).  For example, if you want to set the prompt string  unconditionally  to
              “my prompt string”, set $MANLESS to ‘-Psmy prompt string’.  Using the -r option overrides this environment variable.

       BROWSER
              If  $BROWSER  is  set,  its  value  is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a web browser for man
              --html.  In each command, %s is replaced by a filename containing the HTML output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and
              %c is replaced by a colon (:).

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m option.

       MANOPT If  $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to be in a similar format.  As all of the other man specific
              environment variables can be expressed as command line options, and are thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is expected that they
              will become obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that should be interpreted as part of an option's argument must be escaped.

       MANWIDTH
              If  $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be formatted.  If it is not set, manual pages will be
              formatted with a line length appropriate to the current terminal (using the value of $COLUMNS, and ioctl(2) if available, or falling  back  to
              80  characters if neither is available).  Cat pages will only be saved when the default formatting can be used, that is when the terminal line
              length is between 66 and 80 characters.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              Normally, when output is not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are discarded to make it easier
              to read the result without special tools.  However, if $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING is set to any non-empty value, these formatting characters are re‐
              tained.  This may be useful for wrappers around man that can interpret formatting characters.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              Normally, when output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a pager), any error output from the command used to produce  formatted  ver‐
              sions of manual pages is discarded to avoid interfering with the pager's display.  Programs such as groff often produce relatively minor error
              messages about typographical problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally confusing when displayed along with the manual
              page.   However,  some users want to see them anyway, so, if $MAN_KEEP_STDERR is set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed as
              usual.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              Depending on system and implementation, either or both of $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated for the  current  message  locale.   man
              will display its messages in that locale (if available).  See setlocale(3) for precise details.

NAME
       man - an interface to the system reference manuals

SYNOPSIS
       man [man options] [[section] page ...] ...
       man -k [apropos options] regexp ...
       man -K [man options] [section] term ...
       man -f [whatis options] page ...
       man -l [man options] file ...
       man -w|-W [man options] page ...

DESCRIPTION
       man  is  the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associ‐
       ated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of  the  manual.
       The default action is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found,
       even if page exists in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE, ERRORS, ENVIRONMENT,  FILES,  VER‐
       SIONS, CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact  rendering  may  vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render italics when running in a terminal,
       and will typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable  to  illustrate  several
       exclusive invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

       man man.7
           Display the manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is an alternative spelling of "man 7 man".)

       man 'man(7)'
           Display  the  manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is another alternative spelling of "man 7 man".  It may be more convenient
           when copying and pasting cross-references to manual pages.  Note that the parentheses must normally be quoted to protect them from the shell.)

       man -a intro
           Display, in succession, all of the available intro manual pages contained within the manual.  It is possible to quit between successive  displays
           or skip any of them.

       man -t bash | lpr -Pps
           Format the manual page for bash into the default troff or groff format and pipe it to the printer named ps.  The default output for groff is usu‐
           ally PostScript.  man --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.

       man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a device independent (dvi) file.  The redirection is neces‐
           sary as the -T flag causes output to be directed to stdout with no pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi or further pro‐
           cessed into PostScript using a program such as dvips.

       man -k printf
           Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.  Print out any matches.   Equivalent  to  apro‐
           pos printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short descriptions of any found.  Equivalent to whatis smail.

OVERVIEW
       Many  options are available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes can be made to the search path, section or‐
       der, output processor, and other behaviours and operations detailed below.

       If set, various environment variables are interrogated to determine the operation of man.  It is possible to set the "catch-all" variable $MANOPT  to
       any string in command line format, with the exception that any spaces used as part of an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).
       man will parse $MANOPT prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options requiring an argument will be overridden by the same  options  found  on
       the  command line.  To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be specified as the initial command line option.  This will allow man to "for‐
       get" about the options specified in $MANOPT, although they must still have been valid.

       Manual pages are normally stored in nroff(1) format under a directory such as /usr/share/man.  In some installations, there may also be  preformatted
       cat pages to improve performance.  See manpath(5) for details of where these files are stored.

       This  package supports manual pages in multiple languages, controlled by your locale.  If your system did not set this up for you automatically, then
       you may need to set $LC_MESSAGES, $LANG, or another system-dependent environment variable to indicate your preferred locale, usually specified in the
       POSIX format:

       <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your locale, it will be displayed in lieu of the standard (usually American English) page.

       If you find that the translations supplied with this package are not available in your native language and you would like to supply them, please con‐
       tact the maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.

       Individual manual pages are normally written and maintained by the maintainers of the program, function, or other topic that they document,  and  are
       not  included  with  this  package.  If you find that a manual page is missing or inadequate, please report that to the maintainers of the package in
       question.

       For information regarding other features and extensions available with this manual pager, please read the documents supplied with the package.

DEFAULTS
       The order of sections to search may be overridden by the environment variable $MANSECT or by the SECTION directive in  /etc/manpath.config.   By  de‐
       fault it is as follows:

              1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7

       The  formatted manual page is displayed using a pager.  This can be specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default (see option -P
       for details).

       The filters are deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line option -p or the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is interrogated.  If -p
       was  not  used  and the environment variable was not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain a valid
       preprocessor string, the first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A formatting pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable
       program  mandb_nfmt  (or  mandb_tfmt  with  -t) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets passed the manual source file, the pre‐
       processor string, and optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non-argument options that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both, are not harmful.  For options  that  require  an  argument,
       each duplication will override the previous argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
              This option is normally issued as the very first option and resets man's behaviour to its default.  Its use is to reset those options that may
              have been set in $MANOPT.  Any options that follow -D will have their usual effect.

       --warnings[=warnings]
              Enable warnings from groff.  This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of manual pages.  warnings is a comma-separated list
              of warning names; if it is not supplied, the default is "mac".  See the “Warnings” node in info groff for a list of available warning names.

   Main modes of operation
       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent to whatis.  Display a short description from the manual page, if available.  See whatis(1) for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1) for details.

       -K, --global-apropos
              Search  for text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time; if you can, you should specify a section
              to reduce the number of pages that need to be searched.  Search terms may be simple strings (the  default),  or  regular  expressions  if  the
              --regex option is used.

              Note that this searches the sources of the manual pages, not the rendered text, and so may include false positives due to things like comments
              in source files.  Searching the rendered text would be much slower.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate "local" mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching through the system's manual collection.  Each  manual  page
              argument  will  be  interpreted as an nroff source file in the correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the argu‐
              ments, input will be taken from stdin.  When this option is not used, and man fails to find the page required,  before  displaying  the  error
              message, it attempts to act as if this option was supplied, using the name as a filename and looking for an exact match.

       -w, --where, --path, --location
              Don't  actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the source nroff file that would be formatted.  If the -a option is also
              used, then print the locations of all source files that match the search criteria.

       -W, --where-cat, --location-cat
              Don't actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the preformatted cat file that would be displayed.  If the -a  option  is
              also used, then print the locations of all preformatted cat files that match the search criteria.

              If  -w  and  -W are both used, then print both source file and cat file separated by a space.  If all of -w, -W, and -a are used, then do this
              for each possible match.

       -c, --catman
              This option is not for general use and should only be used by the catman program.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead of formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the specified encoding.  If you already know the encod‐
              ing of the source file, you can also use manconv(1) directly.  However, this option allows you to convert several manual pages to a single en‐
              coding without having to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they were already installed in a structure similar to  a  manual
              page hierarchy.

              Consider  using  man-recode(1) instead for converting multiple manual pages, since it has an interface designed for bulk conversion and so can
              be much faster.

   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              man will normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which  interrogates  various  environment  variables,
              possibly  including  $LC_MESSAGES and $LANG.  To temporarily override the determined value, use this option to supply a locale string directly
              to man.  Note that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such as the help message will  always  be  dis‐
              played in the initially determined locale.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If  this system has access to other operating system's manual pages, they can be accessed using this option.  To search for a manual page from
              NewOS's manual page collection, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include a search of  the  native  operating  system's
              manual pages, include the system name man in the argument string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify  an  alternate  manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath derived code to determine the path to search.  This option overrides the
              $MANPATH environment variable and causes option -m to be ignored.

              A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into sections as described in the  man-db  manual  (under
              "The manual page system").  To view manual pages outside such hierarchies, see the -l option.

       -S list, -s list, --sections=list
              The given list is a colon- or comma-separated list of sections, used to determine which manual sections to search and in what order.  This op‐
              tion overrides the $MANSECT environment variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility with System V.)

       -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension
              Some systems incorporate large packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the Tcl package, into the main  manual  page  hierarchy.
              To get around the problem of having two manual pages with the same name such as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to section l.
              As this is unfortunate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and to assign a specific  "extension"  to  them,  in  this
              case,  exit(3tcl).   Under  normal  operation, man will display exit(3) in preference to exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and to avoid
              having to know which section the page you require resides in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string indicating  which  package
              the page must belong to.  Using the above example, supplying the option -e tcl to man will restrict the search to pages having an extension of
              *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       --regex
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument as a regular expression,  as  with  apro‐
              pos(1).  Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a regular expression, this option implies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show  all  pages  with  any  part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument using shell-style wildcards, as with
              apropos(1) --wildcard.  The page argument must match the entire name or description, or match on word boundaries in  the  description.   Since
              there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a wildcard, this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If the --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names, not page descriptions, as with whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By  default,  man  will  exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.  Using this option forces man to display all the manual
              pages with names that match the search criteria.

       -u, --update
              This option causes man to update its database caches of installed manual pages.  This is only needed in rare situations, and  it  is  normally
              better to run mandb(8) instead.

       --no-subpages
              By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the command line as equivalent to a single manual page name contain‐
              ing a hyphen or an underscore.  This supports the common pattern of programs that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to  provide
              manual pages for each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to invoke the subcommands themselves.  For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify  which  output pager to use.  By default, man uses pager, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.  This option
              overrides the $MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is not used in conjunction with  -f
              or -k.

              The  value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).
              It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an ar‐
              gument or on standard input.

       -r prompt, --prompt=prompt
              If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to set its prompt and some sensible options.  The default prompt looks like

               Manual page name(sec) line x

              where  name denotes the manual page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x the current line number.  This is achieved by using
              the $LESS environment variable.

              Supplying -r with a string will override this default.  The string may contain the text $MAN_PN which will be expanded to the name of the cur‐
              rent manual page and its section name surrounded by "(" and ")".  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              \ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:
              byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..
              (press h for help or q to quit)

              It is broken into three lines here for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the less(1) manual page.  The prompt string is first
              evaluated by the shell.  All double quotes, back-quotes and backslashes in the prompt must be escaped by a preceding  backslash.   The  prompt
              string may end in an escaped $ which may be followed by further options for less.  By default man sets the -ix8 options.

              The $MANLESS environment variable described below may be used to set a default prompt string if none is supplied on the command line.

       -7, --ascii
              When  viewing  a  pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may not display correctly when using the
              latin1(7) device description with GNU nroff.  This option allows pure ascii manual pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1 device.   It
              will  not  translate  any  latin1 text.  The following table shows the translations performed: some parts of it may only be displayed properly
              when using GNU nroff's latin1(7) device.

              Description           Octal   latin1   ascii
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────
              continuation hyphen    255      ‐        -
              bullet (middle dot)    267      •        o
              acute accent           264      ´        '
              multiplication sign    327      ×        x

              If the latin1 column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters and this option is not necessary.   If  the  latin1
              and  ascii columns are identical, you are reading this page using this option or man did not format this page using the latin1 device descrip‐
              tion.  If the latin1 column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual pages with this option.

              This option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for nroff other than GNU's.

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward compatibility, encoding may be an nroff device such  as  ascii,
              latin1, or utf8 as well as a true character encoding such as UTF-8.

       --no-hyphenation, --nh
              Normally, nroff will automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not contain hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to lay
              out words on a line without excessive spacing.  This option disables automatic hyphenation, so words will only be hyphenated if  they  already
              contain hyphens.

              If  you  are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at an inappropriate point, do not use this option,
              but consult the nroff documentation instead; for instance, you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at that point,
              or put "\%" at the start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.

       --no-justification, --nj
              Normally,  nroff will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full justification, leaving justified only to the left
              margin, sometimes called "ragged-right" text.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain paragraphs, do not use this option, but consult  the
              nroff  documentation instead; for instance, you can use the ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting and fill‐
              ing.

       -p string, --preprocessor=string
              Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff/groff.  Not all installations will have a full set of preprocessors.   Some
              of  the  preprocessors  and  the  letters used to designate them are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer (r).  This option
              overrides the $MANROFFSEQ environment variable.  zsoelim is always run as the very first preprocessor.

       -t, --troff
              Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This option is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to be suitable for a device other than the default.  It implies -t.  Examples
              (provided with Groff-1.17) include dvi, latin1, ps, utf8, X75 and X100.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This  option  will  cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web browser.  The choice of browser is determined by
              the optional browser argument if one is provided, by the $BROWSER environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually
              lynx).  This option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.

       -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]
              This option displays the output of groff in a graphical window using the gxditview program.  The dpi (dots per inch) may be 75, 75-12, 100, or
              100-12, defaulting to 75; the -12 variants use a 12-point base font.  This option implies -T with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device re‐
              spectively.

       -Z, --ditroff
              groff  will run troff and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for the chosen device.  If groff -mandoc is groff,
              this option is passed to groff and will suppress the use of a post-processor.  It implies -t.

   Getting help
       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

       MANROFFOPT
              Every time man invokes the formatter (nroff, troff, or groff), it adds the contents of $MANROFFOPT to the formatter's command line.

       MANROFFSEQ
              If $MANROFFSEQ is set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors to pass each manual page  through.   The  default  preprocessor
              list is system dependent.

       MANSECT
              If  $MANSECT  is  set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and it is used to determine which manual sections to search and in what
              order.  The default is "1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7", unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              If $MANPAGER or $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its value is used as the name of the program used to display the manual page.
              By default, pager is used, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.

              The  value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).
              It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an ar‐
              gument or on standard input.

       MANLESS
              If  $MANLESS  is set, its value will be used as the default prompt string for the less pager, as if it had been passed using the -r option (so
              any occurrences of the text $MAN_PN will be expanded in the same way).  For example, if you want to set the prompt string  unconditionally  to
              “my prompt string”, set $MANLESS to ‘-Psmy prompt string’.  Using the -r option overrides this environment variable.

       BROWSER
              If  $BROWSER  is  set,  its  value  is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a web browser for man
              --html.  In each command, %s is replaced by a filename containing the HTML output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and
              %c is replaced by a colon (:).

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m option.

       MANOPT If  $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to be in a similar format.  As all of the other man specific
              environment variables can be expressed as command line options, and are thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is expected that they
              will become obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that should be interpreted as part of an option's argument must be escaped.

       MANWIDTH
              If  $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be formatted.  If it is not set, manual pages will be
              formatted with a line length appropriate to the current terminal (using the value of $COLUMNS, and ioctl(2) if available, or falling  back  to
              80  characters if neither is available).  Cat pages will only be saved when the default formatting can be used, that is when the terminal line
              length is between 66 and 80 characters.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              Normally, when output is not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are discarded to make it easier
              to read the result without special tools.  However, if $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING is set to any non-empty value, these formatting characters are re‐
              tained.  This may be useful for wrappers around man that can interpret formatting characters.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              Normally, when output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a pager), any error output from the command used to produce  formatted  ver‐
              sions of manual pages is discarded to avoid interfering with the pager's display.  Programs such as groff often produce relatively minor error
              messages about typographical problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally confusing when displayed along with the manual
              page.   However,  some users want to see them anyway, so, if $MAN_KEEP_STDERR is set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed as
              usual.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              Depending on system and implementation, either or both of $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated for the  current  message  locale.   man
              will display its messages in that locale (if available).  See setlocale(3) for precise details.

FILES
       /etc/manpath.config
              man-db configuration file.

       /usr/share/man
              A global manual page hierarchy.

NAME
       rm - remove files or directories

SYNOPSIS
       rm [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the GNU version of rm.  rm removes each specified file.  By default, it does not remove directories.

       If  the  -I  or  --interactive=once option is given, and there are more than three files or the -r, -R, or --recursive are given, then rm prompts the
       user for whether to proceed with the entire operation.  If the response is not affirmative, the entire command is aborted.

       Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and the -f or --force option is not given, or the -i or --interactive=always option
       is given, rm prompts the user for whether to remove the file.  If the response is not affirmative, the file is skipped.

OPTIONS
       Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

       -f, --force
              ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt

       -i     prompt before every removal

       -I     prompt once before removing more than three files, or when removing recursively; less intrusive than -i, while still giving protection against
              most mistakes

       --interactive[=WHEN]
              prompt according to WHEN: never, once (-I), or always (-i); without WHEN, prompt always

       --one-file-system
              when removing a hierarchy recursively, skip any directory that is on a file system different from that of the corresponding command line argu‐
              ment

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially

       --preserve-root[=all]
              do not remove '/' (default); with 'all', reject any command line argument on a separate device from its parent

       -r, -R, --recursive
              remove directories and their contents recursively

       -d, --dir
              remove empty directories

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       By  default,  rm does not remove directories.  Use the --recursive (-r or -R) option to remove each listed directory, too, along with all of its con‐
       tents.

       To remove a file whose name starts with a '-', for example '-foo', use one of these commands:

              rm -- -foo

              rm ./-foo

       Note that if you use rm to remove a file, it might be possible to recover some of its contents, given sufficient expertise and/or time.  For  greater
       assurance that the contents are truly unrecoverable, consider using shred.

NAME
       man - an interface to the system reference manuals

SYNOPSIS
       man [man options] [[section] page ...] ...
       man -k [apropos options] regexp ...
       man -K [man options] [section] term ...
       man -f [whatis options] page ...
       man -l [man options] file ...
       man -w|-W [man options] page ...

DESCRIPTION
       man  is  the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associ‐
       ated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of  the  manual.
       The default action is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found,
       even if page exists in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE, ERRORS, ENVIRONMENT,  FILES,  VER‐
       SIONS, CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact  rendering  may  vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render italics when running in a terminal,
       and will typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable  to  illustrate  several
       exclusive invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

       man man.7
           Display the manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is an alternative spelling of "man 7 man".)

       man 'man(7)'
           Display  the  manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is another alternative spelling of "man 7 man".  It may be more convenient
           when copying and pasting cross-references to manual pages.  Note that the parentheses must normally be quoted to protect them from the shell.)

       man -a intro
           Display, in succession, all of the available intro manual pages contained within the manual.  It is possible to quit between successive  displays
           or skip any of them.

       man -t bash | lpr -Pps
           Format the manual page for bash into the default troff or groff format and pipe it to the printer named ps.  The default output for groff is usu‐
           ally PostScript.  man --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.

       man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a device independent (dvi) file.  The redirection is neces‐
           sary as the -T flag causes output to be directed to stdout with no pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi or further pro‐
           cessed into PostScript using a program such as dvips.

       man -k printf
           Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.  Print out any matches.   Equivalent  to  apro‐
           pos printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short descriptions of any found.  Equivalent to whatis smail.

OVERVIEW
       Many  options are available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes can be made to the search path, section or‐
       der, output processor, and other behaviours and operations detailed below.

       If set, various environment variables are interrogated to determine the operation of man.  It is possible to set the "catch-all" variable $MANOPT  to
       any string in command line format, with the exception that any spaces used as part of an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).
       man will parse $MANOPT prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options requiring an argument will be overridden by the same  options  found  on
       the  command line.  To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be specified as the initial command line option.  This will allow man to "for‐
       get" about the options specified in $MANOPT, although they must still have been valid.

       Manual pages are normally stored in nroff(1) format under a directory such as /usr/share/man.  In some installations, there may also be  preformatted
       cat pages to improve performance.  See manpath(5) for details of where these files are stored.

       This  package supports manual pages in multiple languages, controlled by your locale.  If your system did not set this up for you automatically, then
       you may need to set $LC_MESSAGES, $LANG, or another system-dependent environment variable to indicate your preferred locale, usually specified in the
       POSIX format:

       <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your locale, it will be displayed in lieu of the standard (usually American English) page.

       If you find that the translations supplied with this package are not available in your native language and you would like to supply them, please con‐
       tact the maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.

       Individual manual pages are normally written and maintained by the maintainers of the program, function, or other topic that they document,  and  are
       not  included  with  this  package.  If you find that a manual page is missing or inadequate, please report that to the maintainers of the package in
       question.

       For information regarding other features and extensions available with this manual pager, please read the documents supplied with the package.

DEFAULTS
       The order of sections to search may be overridden by the environment variable $MANSECT or by the SECTION directive in  /etc/manpath.config.   By  de‐
       fault it is as follows:

              1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7

       The  formatted manual page is displayed using a pager.  This can be specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default (see option -P
       for details).

       The filters are deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line option -p or the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is interrogated.  If -p
       was  not  used  and the environment variable was not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain a valid
       preprocessor string, the first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A formatting pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable
       program  mandb_nfmt  (or  mandb_tfmt  with  -t) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets passed the manual source file, the pre‐
       processor string, and optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non-argument options that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both, are not harmful.  For options  that  require  an  argument,
       each duplication will override the previous argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
              This option is normally issued as the very first option and resets man's behaviour to its default.  Its use is to reset those options that may
              have been set in $MANOPT.  Any options that follow -D will have their usual effect.

       --warnings[=warnings]
              Enable warnings from groff.  This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of manual pages.  warnings is a comma-separated list
              of warning names; if it is not supplied, the default is "mac".  See the “Warnings” node in info groff for a list of available warning names.

   Main modes of operation
       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent to whatis.  Display a short description from the manual page, if available.  See whatis(1) for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1) for details.

       -K, --global-apropos
              Search  for text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time; if you can, you should specify a section
              to reduce the number of pages that need to be searched.  Search terms may be simple strings (the  default),  or  regular  expressions  if  the
              --regex option is used.

              Note that this searches the sources of the manual pages, not the rendered text, and so may include false positives due to things like comments
              in source files.  Searching the rendered text would be much slower.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate "local" mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching through the system's manual collection.  Each  manual  page
              argument  will  be  interpreted as an nroff source file in the correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the argu‐
              ments, input will be taken from stdin.  When this option is not used, and man fails to find the page required,  before  displaying  the  error
              message, it attempts to act as if this option was supplied, using the name as a filename and looking for an exact match.

       -w, --where, --path, --location
              Don't  actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the source nroff file that would be formatted.  If the -a option is also
              used, then print the locations of all source files that match the search criteria.

       -W, --where-cat, --location-cat
              Don't actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the preformatted cat file that would be displayed.  If the -a  option  is
              also used, then print the locations of all preformatted cat files that match the search criteria.

              If  -w  and  -W are both used, then print both source file and cat file separated by a space.  If all of -w, -W, and -a are used, then do this
              for each possible match.

       -c, --catman
              This option is not for general use and should only be used by the catman program.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead of formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the specified encoding.  If you already know the encod‐
              ing of the source file, you can also use manconv(1) directly.  However, this option allows you to convert several manual pages to a single en‐
              coding without having to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they were already installed in a structure similar to  a  manual
              page hierarchy.

              Consider  using  man-recode(1) instead for converting multiple manual pages, since it has an interface designed for bulk conversion and so can
              be much faster.

   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              man will normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which  interrogates  various  environment  variables,
              possibly  including  $LC_MESSAGES and $LANG.  To temporarily override the determined value, use this option to supply a locale string directly
              to man.  Note that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such as the help message will  always  be  dis‐
              played in the initially determined locale.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If  this system has access to other operating system's manual pages, they can be accessed using this option.  To search for a manual page from
              NewOS's manual page collection, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include a search of  the  native  operating  system's
              manual pages, include the system name man in the argument string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify  an  alternate  manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath derived code to determine the path to search.  This option overrides the
              $MANPATH environment variable and causes option -m to be ignored.

              A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into sections as described in the  man-db  manual  (under
              "The manual page system").  To view manual pages outside such hierarchies, see the -l option.

       -S list, -s list, --sections=list
              The given list is a colon- or comma-separated list of sections, used to determine which manual sections to search and in what order.  This op‐
              tion overrides the $MANSECT environment variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility with System V.)

       -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension
              Some systems incorporate large packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the Tcl package, into the main  manual  page  hierarchy.
              To get around the problem of having two manual pages with the same name such as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to section l.
              As this is unfortunate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and to assign a specific  "extension"  to  them,  in  this
              case,  exit(3tcl).   Under  normal  operation, man will display exit(3) in preference to exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and to avoid
              having to know which section the page you require resides in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string indicating  which  package
              the page must belong to.  Using the above example, supplying the option -e tcl to man will restrict the search to pages having an extension of
              *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       --regex
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument as a regular expression,  as  with  apro‐
              pos(1).  Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a regular expression, this option implies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show  all  pages  with  any  part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument using shell-style wildcards, as with
              apropos(1) --wildcard.  The page argument must match the entire name or description, or match on word boundaries in  the  description.   Since
              there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a wildcard, this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If the --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names, not page descriptions, as with whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By  default,  man  will  exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.  Using this option forces man to display all the manual
              pages with names that match the search criteria.

       -u, --update
              This option causes man to update its database caches of installed manual pages.  This is only needed in rare situations, and  it  is  normally
              better to run mandb(8) instead.

       --no-subpages
              By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the command line as equivalent to a single manual page name contain‐
              ing a hyphen or an underscore.  This supports the common pattern of programs that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to  provide
              manual pages for each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to invoke the subcommands themselves.  For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify  which  output pager to use.  By default, man uses pager, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.  This option
              overrides the $MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is not used in conjunction with  -f
              or -k.

              The  value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).
              It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an ar‐
              gument or on standard input.

       -r prompt, --prompt=prompt
              If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to set its prompt and some sensible options.  The default prompt looks like

               Manual page name(sec) line x

              where  name denotes the manual page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x the current line number.  This is achieved by using
              the $LESS environment variable.

              Supplying -r with a string will override this default.  The string may contain the text $MAN_PN which will be expanded to the name of the cur‐
              rent manual page and its section name surrounded by "(" and ")".  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              \ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:
              byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..
              (press h for help or q to quit)

              It is broken into three lines here for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the less(1) manual page.  The prompt string is first
              evaluated by the shell.  All double quotes, back-quotes and backslashes in the prompt must be escaped by a preceding  backslash.   The  prompt
              string may end in an escaped $ which may be followed by further options for less.  By default man sets the -ix8 options.

              The $MANLESS environment variable described below may be used to set a default prompt string if none is supplied on the command line.

       -7, --ascii
              When  viewing  a  pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may not display correctly when using the
              latin1(7) device description with GNU nroff.  This option allows pure ascii manual pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1 device.   It
              will  not  translate  any  latin1 text.  The following table shows the translations performed: some parts of it may only be displayed properly
              when using GNU nroff's latin1(7) device.

              Description           Octal   latin1   ascii
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────
              continuation hyphen    255      ‐        -
              bullet (middle dot)    267      •        o
              acute accent           264      ´        '
              multiplication sign    327      ×        x

              If the latin1 column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters and this option is not necessary.   If  the  latin1
              and  ascii columns are identical, you are reading this page using this option or man did not format this page using the latin1 device descrip‐
              tion.  If the latin1 column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual pages with this option.

              This option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for nroff other than GNU's.

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward compatibility, encoding may be an nroff device such  as  ascii,
              latin1, or utf8 as well as a true character encoding such as UTF-8.

       --no-hyphenation, --nh
              Normally, nroff will automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not contain hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to lay
              out words on a line without excessive spacing.  This option disables automatic hyphenation, so words will only be hyphenated if  they  already
              contain hyphens.

              If  you  are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at an inappropriate point, do not use this option,
              but consult the nroff documentation instead; for instance, you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at that point,
              or put "\%" at the start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.

       --no-justification, --nj
              Normally,  nroff will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full justification, leaving justified only to the left
              margin, sometimes called "ragged-right" text.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain paragraphs, do not use this option, but consult  the
              nroff  documentation instead; for instance, you can use the ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting and fill‐
              ing.

       -p string, --preprocessor=string
              Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff/groff.  Not all installations will have a full set of preprocessors.   Some
              of  the  preprocessors  and  the  letters used to designate them are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer (r).  This option
              overrides the $MANROFFSEQ environment variable.  zsoelim is always run as the very first preprocessor.

       -t, --troff
              Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This option is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to be suitable for a device other than the default.  It implies -t.  Examples
              (provided with Groff-1.17) include dvi, latin1, ps, utf8, X75 and X100.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This  option  will  cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web browser.  The choice of browser is determined by
              the optional browser argument if one is provided, by the $BROWSER environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually
              lynx).  This option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.

       -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]
              This option displays the output of groff in a graphical window using the gxditview program.  The dpi (dots per inch) may be 75, 75-12, 100, or
              100-12, defaulting to 75; the -12 variants use a 12-point base font.  This option implies -T with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device re‐
              spectively.

       -Z, --ditroff
              groff  will run troff and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for the chosen device.  If groff -mandoc is groff,
              this option is passed to groff and will suppress the use of a post-processor.  It implies -t.

   Getting help
       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

       MANROFFOPT
              Every time man invokes the formatter (nroff, troff, or groff), it adds the contents of $MANROFFOPT to the formatter's command line.

       MANROFFSEQ
              If $MANROFFSEQ is set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors to pass each manual page  through.   The  default  preprocessor
              list is system dependent.

       MANSECT
              If  $MANSECT  is  set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and it is used to determine which manual sections to search and in what
              order.  The default is "1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7", unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              If $MANPAGER or $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its value is used as the name of the program used to display the manual page.
              By default, pager is used, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.

              The  value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).
              It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an ar‐
              gument or on standard input.

       MANLESS
              If  $MANLESS  is set, its value will be used as the default prompt string for the less pager, as if it had been passed using the -r option (so
              any occurrences of the text $MAN_PN will be expanded in the same way).  For example, if you want to set the prompt string  unconditionally  to
              “my prompt string”, set $MANLESS to ‘-Psmy prompt string’.  Using the -r option overrides this environment variable.

       BROWSER
              If  $BROWSER  is  set,  its  value  is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a web browser for man
              --html.  In each command, %s is replaced by a filename containing the HTML output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and
              %c is replaced by a colon (:).

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m option.

       MANOPT If  $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to be in a similar format.  As all of the other man specific
              environment variables can be expressed as command line options, and are thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is expected that they
              will become obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that should be interpreted as part of an option's argument must be escaped.

       MANWIDTH
              If  $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be formatted.  If it is not set, manual pages will be
              formatted with a line length appropriate to the current terminal (using the value of $COLUMNS, and ioctl(2) if available, or falling  back  to
              80  characters if neither is available).  Cat pages will only be saved when the default formatting can be used, that is when the terminal line
              length is between 66 and 80 characters.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              Normally, when output is not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are discarded to make it easier
              to read the result without special tools.  However, if $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING is set to any non-empty value, these formatting characters are re‐
              tained.  This may be useful for wrappers around man that can interpret formatting characters.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              Normally, when output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a pager), any error output from the command used to produce  formatted  ver‐
              sions of manual pages is discarded to avoid interfering with the pager's display.  Programs such as groff often produce relatively minor error
              messages about typographical problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally confusing when displayed along with the manual
              page.   However,  some users want to see them anyway, so, if $MAN_KEEP_STDERR is set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed as
              usual.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              Depending on system and implementation, either or both of $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated for the  current  message  locale.   man
              will display its messages in that locale (if available).  See setlocale(3) for precise details.

FILES
       /etc/manpath.config
              man-db configuration file.

NAME
       chmod - change file mode bits

SYNOPSIS
       chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page  documents the GNU version of chmod.  chmod changes the file mode bits of each given file according to mode, which can be either a
       symbolic representation of changes to make, or an octal number representing the bit pattern for the new mode bits.

       The format of a symbolic mode is [ugoa...][[-+=][perms...]...], where perms is either zero or more letters from the set rwxXst, or  a  single  letter
       from the set ugo.  Multiple symbolic modes can be given, separated by commas.

       A combination of the letters ugoa controls which users' access to the file will be changed: the user who owns it (u), other users in the file's group
       (g), other users not in the file's group (o), or all users (a).  If none of these are given, the effect is as if (a) were given, but  bits  that  are
       set in the umask are not affected.

       The  operator + causes the selected file mode bits to be added to the existing file mode bits of each file; - causes them to be removed; and = causes
       them to be added and causes unmentioned bits to be removed except that a directory's unmentioned set user and group ID bits are not affected.

       The letters rwxXst select file mode bits for the affected users: read (r), write (w), execute (or search for directories) (x), execute/search only if
       the  file  is  a  directory  or  already has execute permission for some user (X), set user or group ID on execution (s), restricted deletion flag or
       sticky bit (t).  Instead of one or more of these letters, you can specify exactly one of the letters ugo: the permissions granted  to  the  user  who
       owns  the  file (u), the permissions granted to other users who are members of the file's group (g), and the permissions granted to users that are in
       neither of the two preceding categories (o).

       A numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.  Omitted digits are assumed to be lead‐
       ing  zeros.  The first digit selects the set user ID (4) and set group ID (2) and restricted deletion or sticky (1) attributes.  The second digit se‐
       lects permissions for the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2), and execute (1); the third selects permissions for other users in  the  file's
       group, with the same values; and the fourth for other users not in the file's group, with the same values.

       chmod  never  changes the permissions of symbolic links; the chmod system call cannot change their permissions.  This is not a problem since the per‐
       missions of symbolic links are never used.  However, for each symbolic link listed on the command line, chmod changes the permissions of the pointed-
       to file.  In contrast, chmod ignores symbolic links encountered during recursive directory traversals.

SETUID AND SETGID BITS
       chmod  clears the set-group-ID bit of a regular file if the file's group ID does not match the user's effective group ID or one of the user's supple‐
       mentary group IDs, unless the user has appropriate privileges.  Additional restrictions may cause the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits  of  MODE  or
       RFILE to be ignored.  This behavior depends on the policy and functionality of the underlying chmod system call.  When in doubt, check the underlying
       system behavior.

       For directories chmod preserves set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits unless you explicitly specify otherwise.  You can set or clear the bits  with  sym‐
       bolic modes like u+s and g-s.  To clear these bits for directories with a numeric mode requires an additional leading zero, or leading = like 00755 ,
       or =755

RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT
       The restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose interpretation depends on the file type.  For directories, it prevents unprivileged
       users  from  removing  or renaming a file in the directory unless they own the file or the directory; this is called the restricted deletion flag for
       the directory, and is commonly found on world-writable directories like /tmp.  For regular files on some older systems, the bit saves  the  program's
       text image on the swap device so it will load more quickly when run; this is called the sticky bit.

OPTIONS
       Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.  With --reference, change the mode of each FILE to that of RFILE.

       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       -f, --silent, --quiet
              suppress most error messages

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on '/'

       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE's mode instead of MODE values

       -R, --recursive
              change files and directories recursively

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Each MODE is of the form '[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+|[-+=][0-7]+'.

NAME
       man - an interface to the system reference manuals

SYNOPSIS
       man [man options] [[section] page ...] ...
       man -k [apropos options] regexp ...
       man -K [man options] [section] term ...
       man -f [whatis options] page ...
       man -l [man options] file ...
       man -w|-W [man options] page ...

DESCRIPTION
       man  is  the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associ‐
       ated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of  the  manual.
       The default action is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found,
       even if page exists in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE, ERRORS, ENVIRONMENT,  FILES,  VER‐
       SIONS, CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact  rendering  may  vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render italics when running in a terminal,
       and will typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable  to  illustrate  several
       exclusive invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

       man man.7
           Display the manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is an alternative spelling of "man 7 man".)

       man 'man(7)'
           Display  the  manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is another alternative spelling of "man 7 man".  It may be more convenient
           when copying and pasting cross-references to manual pages.  Note that the parentheses must normally be quoted to protect them from the shell.)

       man -a intro
           Display, in succession, all of the available intro manual pages contained within the manual.  It is possible to quit between successive  displays
           or skip any of them.

       man -t bash | lpr -Pps
           Format the manual page for bash into the default troff or groff format and pipe it to the printer named ps.  The default output for groff is usu‐
           ally PostScript.  man --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.

       man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a device independent (dvi) file.  The redirection is neces‐
           sary as the -T flag causes output to be directed to stdout with no pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi or further pro‐
           cessed into PostScript using a program such as dvips.

       man -k printf
           Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.  Print out any matches.   Equivalent  to  apro‐
           pos printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short descriptions of any found.  Equivalent to whatis smail.

OVERVIEW
       Many  options are available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes can be made to the search path, section or‐
       der, output processor, and other behaviours and operations detailed below.

       If set, various environment variables are interrogated to determine the operation of man.  It is possible to set the "catch-all" variable $MANOPT  to
       any string in command line format, with the exception that any spaces used as part of an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).
       man will parse $MANOPT prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options requiring an argument will be overridden by the same  options  found  on
       the  command line.  To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be specified as the initial command line option.  This will allow man to "for‐
       get" about the options specified in $MANOPT, although they must still have been valid.

       Manual pages are normally stored in nroff(1) format under a directory such as /usr/share/man.  In some installations, there may also be  preformatted
       cat pages to improve performance.  See manpath(5) for details of where these files are stored.

       This  package supports manual pages in multiple languages, controlled by your locale.  If your system did not set this up for you automatically, then
       you may need to set $LC_MESSAGES, $LANG, or another system-dependent environment variable to indicate your preferred locale, usually specified in the
       POSIX format:

       <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your locale, it will be displayed in lieu of the standard (usually American English) page.

       If you find that the translations supplied with this package are not available in your native language and you would like to supply them, please con‐
       tact the maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.

       Individual manual pages are normally written and maintained by the maintainers of the program, function, or other topic that they document,  and  are
       not  included  with  this  package.  If you find that a manual page is missing or inadequate, please report that to the maintainers of the package in
       question.

       For information regarding other features and extensions available with this manual pager, please read the documents supplied with the package.

DEFAULTS
       The order of sections to search may be overridden by the environment variable $MANSECT or by the SECTION directive in  /etc/manpath.config.   By  de‐
       fault it is as follows:

              1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7

       The  formatted manual page is displayed using a pager.  This can be specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default (see option -P
       for details).

       The filters are deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line option -p or the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is interrogated.  If -p
       was  not  used  and the environment variable was not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain a valid
       preprocessor string, the first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A formatting pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable
       program  mandb_nfmt  (or  mandb_tfmt  with  -t) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets passed the manual source file, the pre‐
       processor string, and optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non-argument options that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both, are not harmful.  For options  that  require  an  argument,
       each duplication will override the previous argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
              This option is normally issued as the very first option and resets man's behaviour to its default.  Its use is to reset those options that may
              have been set in $MANOPT.  Any options that follow -D will have their usual effect.

       --warnings[=warnings]
              Enable warnings from groff.  This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of manual pages.  warnings is a comma-separated list
              of warning names; if it is not supplied, the default is "mac".  See the “Warnings” node in info groff for a list of available warning names.

   Main modes of operation
       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent to whatis.  Display a short description from the manual page, if available.  See whatis(1) for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1) for details.

       -K, --global-apropos
              Search  for text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time; if you can, you should specify a section
              to reduce the number of pages that need to be searched.  Search terms may be simple strings (the  default),  or  regular  expressions  if  the
              --regex option is used.

              Note that this searches the sources of the manual pages, not the rendered text, and so may include false positives due to things like comments
              in source files.  Searching the rendered text would be much slower.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate "local" mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching through the system's manual collection.  Each  manual  page
              argument  will  be  interpreted as an nroff source file in the correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the argu‐
              ments, input will be taken from stdin.  When this option is not used, and man fails to find the page required,  before  displaying  the  error
              message, it attempts to act as if this option was supplied, using the name as a filename and looking for an exact match.

       -w, --where, --path, --location
              Don't  actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the source nroff file that would be formatted.  If the -a option is also
              used, then print the locations of all source files that match the search criteria.

       -W, --where-cat, --location-cat
              Don't actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the preformatted cat file that would be displayed.  If the -a  option  is
              also used, then print the locations of all preformatted cat files that match the search criteria.

              If  -w  and  -W are both used, then print both source file and cat file separated by a space.  If all of -w, -W, and -a are used, then do this
              for each possible match.

       -c, --catman
              This option is not for general use and should only be used by the catman program.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead of formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the specified encoding.  If you already know the encod‐
              ing of the source file, you can also use manconv(1) directly.  However, this option allows you to convert several manual pages to a single en‐
              coding without having to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they were already installed in a structure similar to  a  manual
              page hierarchy.

              Consider  using  man-recode(1) instead for converting multiple manual pages, since it has an interface designed for bulk conversion and so can
              be much faster.

   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              man will normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which  interrogates  various  environment  variables,
              possibly  including  $LC_MESSAGES and $LANG.  To temporarily override the determined value, use this option to supply a locale string directly
              to man.  Note that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such as the help message will  always  be  dis‐
              played in the initially determined locale.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If  this system has access to other operating system's manual pages, they can be accessed using this option.  To search for a manual page from
              NewOS's manual page collection, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include a search of  the  native  operating  system's
              manual pages, include the system name man in the argument string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify  an  alternate  manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath derived code to determine the path to search.  This option overrides the
              $MANPATH environment variable and causes option -m to be ignored.

              A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into sections as described in the  man-db  manual  (under
              "The manual page system").  To view manual pages outside such hierarchies, see the -l option.

       -S list, -s list, --sections=list
              The given list is a colon- or comma-separated list of sections, used to determine which manual sections to search and in what order.  This op‐
              tion overrides the $MANSECT environment variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility with System V.)

       -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension
              Some systems incorporate large packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the Tcl package, into the main  manual  page  hierarchy.
              To get around the problem of having two manual pages with the same name such as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to section l.
              As this is unfortunate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and to assign a specific  "extension"  to  them,  in  this
              case,  exit(3tcl).   Under  normal  operation, man will display exit(3) in preference to exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and to avoid
              having to know which section the page you require resides in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string indicating  which  package
              the page must belong to.  Using the above example, supplying the option -e tcl to man will restrict the search to pages having an extension of
              *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       --regex
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument as a regular expression,  as  with  apro‐
              pos(1).  Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a regular expression, this option implies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show  all  pages  with  any  part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument using shell-style wildcards, as with
              apropos(1) --wildcard.  The page argument must match the entire name or description, or match on word boundaries in  the  description.   Since
              there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a wildcard, this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If the --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names, not page descriptions, as with whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By  default,  man  will  exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.  Using this option forces man to display all the manual
              pages with names that match the search criteria.

       -u, --update
              This option causes man to update its database caches of installed manual pages.  This is only needed in rare situations, and  it  is  normally
              better to run mandb(8) instead.

       --no-subpages
              By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the command line as equivalent to a single manual page name contain‐
              ing a hyphen or an underscore.  This supports the common pattern of programs that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to  provide
              manual pages for each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to invoke the subcommands themselves.  For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify  which  output pager to use.  By default, man uses pager, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.  This option
              overrides the $MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is not used in conjunction with  -f
              or -k.

              The  value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).
              It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an ar‐
              gument or on standard input.

       -r prompt, --prompt=prompt
              If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to set its prompt and some sensible options.  The default prompt looks like

               Manual page name(sec) line x

              where  name denotes the manual page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x the current line number.  This is achieved by using
              the $LESS environment variable.

              Supplying -r with a string will override this default.  The string may contain the text $MAN_PN which will be expanded to the name of the cur‐
              rent manual page and its section name surrounded by "(" and ")".  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              \ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:
              byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..
              (press h for help or q to quit)

              It is broken into three lines here for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the less(1) manual page.  The prompt string is first
              evaluated by the shell.  All double quotes, back-quotes and backslashes in the prompt must be escaped by a preceding  backslash.   The  prompt
              string may end in an escaped $ which may be followed by further options for less.  By default man sets the -ix8 options.

              The $MANLESS environment variable described below may be used to set a default prompt string if none is supplied on the command line.

       -7, --ascii
              When  viewing  a  pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may not display correctly when using the
              latin1(7) device description with GNU nroff.  This option allows pure ascii manual pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1 device.   It
              will  not  translate  any  latin1 text.  The following table shows the translations performed: some parts of it may only be displayed properly
              when using GNU nroff's latin1(7) device.

              Description           Octal   latin1   ascii
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────
              continuation hyphen    255      ‐        -
              bullet (middle dot)    267      •        o
              acute accent           264      ´        '
              multiplication sign    327      ×        x

              If the latin1 column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters and this option is not necessary.   If  the  latin1
              and  ascii columns are identical, you are reading this page using this option or man did not format this page using the latin1 device descrip‐
              tion.  If the latin1 column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual pages with this option.

              This option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for nroff other than GNU's.

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward compatibility, encoding may be an nroff device such  as  ascii,
              latin1, or utf8 as well as a true character encoding such as UTF-8.

       --no-hyphenation, --nh
              Normally, nroff will automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not contain hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to lay
              out words on a line without excessive spacing.  This option disables automatic hyphenation, so words will only be hyphenated if  they  already
              contain hyphens.

              If  you  are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at an inappropriate point, do not use this option,
              but consult the nroff documentation instead; for instance, you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at that point,
              or put "\%" at the start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.

       --no-justification, --nj
              Normally,  nroff will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full justification, leaving justified only to the left
              margin, sometimes called "ragged-right" text.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain paragraphs, do not use this option, but consult  the
              nroff  documentation instead; for instance, you can use the ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting and fill‐
              ing.

       -p string, --preprocessor=string
              Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff/groff.  Not all installations will have a full set of preprocessors.   Some
              of  the  preprocessors  and  the  letters used to designate them are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer (r).  This option
              overrides the $MANROFFSEQ environment variable.  zsoelim is always run as the very first preprocessor.

       -t, --troff
              Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This option is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to be suitable for a device other than the default.  It implies -t.  Examples
              (provided with Groff-1.17) include dvi, latin1, ps, utf8, X75 and X100.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This  option  will  cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web browser.  The choice of browser is determined by
              the optional browser argument if one is provided, by the $BROWSER environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually
              lynx).  This option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.

       -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]
              This option displays the output of groff in a graphical window using the gxditview program.  The dpi (dots per inch) may be 75, 75-12, 100, or
              100-12, defaulting to 75; the -12 variants use a 12-point base font.  This option implies -T with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device re‐
              spectively.

       -Z, --ditroff
              groff  will run troff and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for the chosen device.  If groff -mandoc is groff,
              this option is passed to groff and will suppress the use of a post-processor.  It implies -t.

   Getting help
       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

       MANROFFOPT
              Every time man invokes the formatter (nroff, troff, or groff), it adds the contents of $MANROFFOPT to the formatter's command line.

       MANROFFSEQ
              If $MANROFFSEQ is set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors to pass each manual page  through.   The  default  preprocessor
              list is system dependent.

       MANSECT
              If  $MANSECT  is  set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and it is used to determine which manual sections to search and in what
              order.  The default is "1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7", unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              If $MANPAGER or $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its value is used as the name of the program used to display the manual page.
              By default, pager is used, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.

              The  value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).
              It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an ar‐
              gument or on standard input.

       MANLESS
              If  $MANLESS  is set, its value will be used as the default prompt string for the less pager, as if it had been passed using the -r option (so
              any occurrences of the text $MAN_PN will be expanded in the same way).  For example, if you want to set the prompt string  unconditionally  to
              “my prompt string”, set $MANLESS to ‘-Psmy prompt string’.  Using the -r option overrides this environment variable.

       BROWSER
              If  $BROWSER  is  set,  its  value  is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a web browser for man
              --html.  In each command, %s is replaced by a filename containing the HTML output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and
              %c is replaced by a colon (:).

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m option.

       MANOPT If  $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to be in a similar format.  As all of the other man specific
              environment variables can be expressed as command line options, and are thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is expected that they
              will become obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that should be interpreted as part of an option's argument must be escaped.

       MANWIDTH
              If  $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be formatted.  If it is not set, manual pages will be
              formatted with a line length appropriate to the current terminal (using the value of $COLUMNS, and ioctl(2) if available, or falling  back  to
              80  characters if neither is available).  Cat pages will only be saved when the default formatting can be used, that is when the terminal line
              length is between 66 and 80 characters.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              Normally, when output is not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are discarded to make it easier
              to read the result without special tools.  However, if $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING is set to any non-empty value, these formatting characters are re‐
              tained.  This may be useful for wrappers around man that can interpret formatting characters.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              Normally, when output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a pager), any error output from the command used to produce  formatted  ver‐
              sions of manual pages is discarded to avoid interfering with the pager's display.  Programs such as groff often produce relatively minor error
              messages about typographical problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally confusing when displayed along with the manual
              page.   However,  some users want to see them anyway, so, if $MAN_KEEP_STDERR is set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed as
              usual.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              Depending on system and implementation, either or both of $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated for the  current  message  locale.   man
              will display its messages in that locale (if available).  See setlocale(3) for precise details.

FILES
       /etc/manpath.config
              man-db configuration file.

       /usr/share/man

SYNOPSIS
       ps [options]

DESCRIPTION
       ps displays information about a selection of the active processes.  If you want a repetitive update of the selection and the displayed information,
       use top(1) instead.

       This version of ps accepts several kinds of options:

       1   UNIX options, which may be grouped and must be preceded by a dash.
       2   BSD options, which may be grouped and must not be used with a dash.
       3   GNU long options, which are preceded by two dashes.

       Options of different types may be freely mixed, but conflicts can appear.  There are some synonymous options, which are functionally identical, due
       to the many standards and ps implementations that this ps is compatible with.

       Note that "ps -aux" is distinct from "ps aux".  The POSIX and UNIX standards require that "ps -aux" print all processes owned by a user named "x", as
       well as printing all processes that would be selected by the -a option.  If the user named "x" does not exist, this ps may interpret the command as
       "ps aux" instead and print a warning.  This behavior is intended to aid in transitioning old scripts and habits.  It is fragile, subject to change,
       and thus should not be relied upon.

       By default, ps selects all processes with the same effective user ID (euid=EUID) as the current user and associated with the same terminal as the
       invoker.  It displays the process ID (pid=PID), the terminal associated with the process (tname=TTY), the cumulated CPU time in [DD-]hh:mm:ss format
       (time=TIME), and the executable name (ucmd=CMD).  Output is unsorted by default.

       The use of BSD-style options will add process state (stat=STAT) to the default display and show the command args (args=COMMAND) instead of the
       executable name.  You can override this with the PS_FORMAT environment variable.  The use of BSD-style options will also change the process selection
       to include processes on other terminals (TTYs) that are owned by you; alternately, this may be described as setting the selection to be the set of
       all processes filtered to exclude processes owned by other users or not on a terminal.  These effects are not considered when options are described
       as being "identical" below, so -M will be considered identical to Z and so on.

       Except as described below, process selection options are additive.  The default selection is discarded, and then the selected processes are added to
       the set of processes to be displayed.  A process will thus be shown if it meets any of the given selection criteria.

EXAMPLES
       To see every process on the system using standard syntax:
          ps -e
          ps -ef
          ps -eF
          ps -ely

       To see every process on the system using BSD syntax:
          ps ax
          ps axu

       To print a process tree:
          ps -ejH
          ps axjf

       To get info about threads:
          ps -eLf
          ps axms

       To get security info:
          ps -eo euser,ruser,suser,fuser,f,comm,label
          ps axZ
          ps -eM

       To see every process running as root (real & effective ID) in user format:
          ps -U root -u root u

       To see every process with a user-defined format:
          ps -eo pid,tid,class,rtprio,ni,pri,psr,pcpu,stat,wchan:14,comm
          ps axo stat,euid,ruid,tty,tpgid,sess,pgrp,ppid,pid,pcpu,comm
          ps -Ao pid,tt,user,fname,tmout,f,wchan

       Print only the process IDs of syslogd:
          ps -C syslogd -o pid=

       Print only the name of PID 42:
          ps -q 42 -o comm=

SIMPLE PROCESS SELECTION
       a      Lift the BSD-style "only yourself" restriction, which is imposed upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style (without "-") options are
              used or when the ps personality setting is BSD-like.  The set of processes selected in this manner is in addition to the set of processes
              selected by other means.  An alternate description is that this option causes ps to list all processes with a terminal (tty), or to list all
              processes when used together with the x option.

       -A     Select all processes.  Identical to -e.

       -a     Select all processes except both session leaders (see getsid(2)) and processes not associated with a terminal.

       -d     Select all processes except session leaders.

       --deselect
              Select all processes except those that fulfill the specified conditions (negates the selection).  Identical to -N.

       -e     Select all processes.  Identical to -A.

       g      Really all, even session leaders.  This flag is obsolete and may be discontinued in a future release.  It is normally implied by the a flag,
              and is only useful when operating in the sunos4 personality.

       -N     Select all processes except those that fulfill the specified conditions (negates the selection).  Identical to --deselect.

       T      Select all processes associated with this terminal.  Identical to the t option without any argument.

       r      Restrict the selection to only running processes.

       x      Lift the BSD-style "must have a tty" restriction, which is imposed upon the set of all processes when some BSD-style (without "-") options are
              used or when the ps personality setting is BSD-like.  The set of processes selected in this manner is in addition to the set of processes
              selected by other means.  An alternate description is that this option causes ps to list all processes owned by you (same EUID as ps), or to
              list all processes when used together with the a option.

PROCESS SELECTION BY LIST
       These options accept a single argument in the form of a blank-separated or comma-separated list.  They can be used multiple times.  For example:
       ps -p "1 2" -p 3,4

       -123   Identical to --pid 123.

       123    Identical to --pid 123.

       -C cmdlist
              Select by command name.  This selects the processes whose executable name is given in cmdlist.  NOTE: The command name is not the same as the
              command line. Previous versions of procps and the kernel truncated this command name to 15 characters. This limitation is no longer present in
              both. If you depended on matching only 15 characters, you may no longer get a match.

       -G grplist
              Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  This selects the processes whose real group name or ID is in the grplist list.  The real group ID
              identifies the group of the user who created the process, see getgid(2).

       -g grplist
              Select by session OR by effective group name.  Selection by session is specified by many standards, but selection by effective group is the
              logical behavior that several other operating systems use.  This ps will select by session when the list is completely numeric (as sessions
              are).  Group ID numbers will work only when some group names are also specified.  See the -s and --group options.

       --Group grplist
              Select by real group ID (RGID) or name.  Identical to -G.

       --group grplist
              Select by effective group ID (EGID) or name.  This selects the processes whose effective group name or ID is in grplist.  The effective group
              ID describes the group whose file access permissions are used by the process (see getegid(2)).  The -g option is often an alternative to
              --group.

       p pidlist
              Select by process ID.  Identical to -p and --pid.

       -p pidlist
              Select by PID.  This selects the processes whose process ID numbers appear in pidlist.  Identical to p and --pid.

       --pid pidlist
              Select by process ID.  Identical to -p and p.

       --ppid pidlist
              Select by parent process ID.  This selects the processes with a parent process ID in pidlist.  That is, it selects processes that are children
              of those listed in pidlist.

       q pidlist
              Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to -q and --quick-pid.

       -q pidlist
              Select by PID (quick mode).  This selects the processes whose process ID numbers appear in pidlist.  With this option ps reads the necessary
              info only for the pids listed in the pidlist and doesn't apply additional filtering rules.  The order of pids is unsorted and preserved.  No
              additional selection options, sorting and forest type listings are allowed in this mode.  Identical to q and --quick-pid.

       --quick-pid pidlist
              Select by process ID (quick mode).  Identical to -q and q.

       -s sesslist
              Select by session ID.  This selects the processes with a session ID specified in sesslist.

       --sid sesslist
              Select by session ID.  Identical to -s.

       t ttylist
              Select by tty.  Nearly identical to -t and --tty, but can also be used with an empty ttylist to indicate the terminal associated with ps.
              Using the T option is considered cleaner than using t with an empty ttylist.

       -t ttylist
              Select by tty.  This selects the processes associated with the terminals given in ttylist.  Terminals (ttys, or screens for text output) can
              be specified in several forms: /dev/ttyS1, ttyS1, S1.  A plain "-" may be used to select processes not attached to any terminal.

       --tty ttylist
              Select by terminal.  Identical to -t and t.

       U userlist
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects the processes whose effective user name or ID is in userlist.  The effective user ID
              describes the user whose file access permissions are used by the process (see geteuid(2)).  Identical to -u and --user.

       -U userlist
              Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.  It selects the processes whose real user name or ID is in the userlist list.  The real user ID
              identifies the user who created the process, see getuid(2).

       -u userlist
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  This selects the processes whose effective user name or ID is in userlist.

              The effective user ID describes the user whose file access permissions are used by the process (see geteuid(2)).  Identical to U and --user.

       --User userlist
              Select by real user ID (RUID) or name.  Identical to -U.

       --user userlist
              Select by effective user ID (EUID) or name.  Identical to -u and U.

OUTPUT FORMAT CONTROL
       These options are used to choose the information displayed by ps.  The output may differ by personality.

       -c     Show different scheduler information for the -l option.

       --context
              Display security context format (for SELinux).

       -f     Do full-format listing.  This option can be combined with many other UNIX-style options to add additional columns.  It also causes the command
              arguments to be printed.  When used with -L, the NLWP (number of threads) and LWP (thread ID) columns will be added.  See the c option, the
              format keyword args, and the format keyword comm.

       -F     Extra full format.  See the -f option, which -F implies.

       --format format
              user-defined format.  Identical to -o and o.

       j      BSD job control format.

       -j     Jobs format.

       l      Display BSD long format.

       -l     Long format.  The -y option is often useful with this.

       -M     Add a column of security data.  Identical to Z (for SELinux).

       O format
              is preloaded o (overloaded).  The BSD O option can act like -O (user-defined output format with some common fields predefined) or can be used
              to specify sort order.  Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this option.  To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained
              (sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other way (e.g.  with -O or --sort).  When used as a formatting option, it is identical to
              -O, with the BSD personality.

       -O format
              Like -o, but preloaded with some default columns.  Identical to -o pid,format,state,tname,time,command or -o pid,format,tname,time,cmd, see -o
              below.

       o format
              Specify user-defined format.  Identical to -o and --format.

       -o format
              User-defined format.  format is a single argument in the form of a blank-separated or comma-separated list, which offers a way to specify
              individual output columns.  The recognized keywords are described in the STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section below.  Headers may be renamed (ps
              -o pid,ruser=RealUser -o comm=Command) as desired.  If all column headers are empty (ps -o pid= -o comm=) then the header line will not be
              output.  Column width will increase as needed for wide headers; this may be used to widen up columns such as WCHAN (ps -o pid,wchan=WIDE-
              WCHAN-COLUMN -o comm).  Explicit width control (ps opid,wchan:42,cmd) is offered too.  The behavior of ps -o pid=X,comm=Y varies with
              personality; output may be one column named "X,comm=Y" or two columns named "X" and "Y".  Use multiple -o options when in doubt.  Use the
              PS_FORMAT environment variable to specify a default as desired; DefSysV and DefBSD are macros that may be used to choose the default UNIX or
              BSD columns.

       s      Display signal format.

       u      Display user-oriented format.

       v      Display virtual memory format.

       X      Register format.

       -y     Do not show flags; show rss in place of addr.  This option can only be used with -l.

       Z      Add a column of security data.  Identical to -M (for SELinux).

OUTPUT MODIFIERS
       c      Show the true command name.  This is derived from the name of the executable file, rather than from the argv value.  Command arguments and any
              modifications to them are thus not shown.  This option effectively turns the args format keyword into the comm format keyword; it is useful
              with the -f format option and with the various BSD-style format options, which all normally display the command arguments.  See the -f option,
              the format keyword args, and the format keyword comm.

       --cols n
              Set screen width.

       --columns n
              Set screen width.

       --cumulative
              Include some dead child process data (as a sum with the parent).

       e      Show the environment after the command.

       f      ASCII art process hierarchy (forest).

       --forest
              ASCII art process tree.

       h      No header.  (or, one header per screen in the BSD personality).  The h option is problematic.  Standard BSD ps uses this option to print a
              header on each page of output, but older Linux ps uses this option to totally disable the header.  This version of ps follows the Linux usage
              of not printing the header unless the BSD personality has been selected, in which case it prints a header on each page of output.  Regardless
              of the current personality, you can use the long options --headers and --no-headers to enable printing headers each page or disable headers
              entirely, respectively.

       -H     Show process hierarchy (forest).

       --headers
              Repeat header lines, one per page of output.

       k spec Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is [+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,...]].  Choose a multi-letter key from the STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section.
              The "+" is optional since default direction is increasing numerical or lexicographic order.  Identical to --sort.

                      Examples:
                      ps jaxkuid,-ppid,+pid
                      ps axk comm o comm,args
                      ps kstart_time -ef

       --lines n
              Set screen height.

       n      Numeric output for WCHAN and USER (including all types of UID and GID).

       --no-headers
              Print no header line at all.  --no-heading is an alias for this option.

       O order
              Sorting order (overloaded).  The BSD O option can act like -O (user-defined output format with some common fields predefined) or can be used
              to specify sort order.  Heuristics are used to determine the behavior of this option.  To ensure that the desired behavior is obtained
              (sorting or formatting), specify the option in some other way (e.g.  with -O or --sort).

              For sorting, obsolete BSD O option syntax is O[+|-]k1[,[+|-]k2[,...]].  It orders the processes listing according to the multilevel sort
              specified by the sequence of one-letter short keys k1,k2, ... described in the OBSOLETE SORT KEYS section below.  The "+" is currently
              optional, merely re-iterating the default direction on a key, but may help to distinguish an O sort from an O format.  The "-" reverses
              direction only on the key it precedes.

       --rows n
              Set screen height.

       S      Sum up some information, such as CPU usage, from dead child processes into their parent.  This is useful for examining a system where a parent
              process repeatedly forks off short-lived children to do work.

       --sort spec
              Specify sorting order.  Sorting syntax is [+|-]key[,[+|-]key[,...]].  Choose a multi-letter key from the STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section.
              The "+" is optional since default direction is increasing numerical or lexicographic order.  Identical to k.  For example: ps jax --sort=uid,
              -ppid,+pid

       w      Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.

       -w     Wide output.  Use this option twice for unlimited width.

       --width n
              Set screen width.

THREAD DISPLAY
       H      Show threads as if they were processes.

       -L     Show threads, possibly with LWP and NLWP columns.

       m      Show threads after processes.

       -m     Show threads after processes.

       -T     Show threads, possibly with SPID column.

OTHER INFORMATION
       --help section
              Print a help message.  The section argument can be one of simple, list, output, threads, misc, or all.  The argument can be shortened to one
              of the underlined letters as in: s|l|o|t|m|a.

       --info Print debugging info.

       L      List all format specifiers.

       V      Print the procps-ng version.

       -V     Print the procps-ng version.

       --version
              Print the procps-ng version.

NOTES
       This ps works by reading the virtual files in /proc.  This ps does not need to be setuid kmem or have any privileges to run.  Do not give this ps any
       special permissions.

       CPU usage is currently expressed as the percentage of time spent running during the entire lifetime of a process.  This is not ideal, and it does not
       conform to the standards that ps otherwise conforms to.  CPU usage is unlikely to add up to exactly 100%.

       The SIZE and RSS fields don't count some parts of a process including the page tables, kernel stack, struct thread_info, and struct task_struct.
       This is usually at least 20 KiB of memory that is always resident.  SIZE is the virtual size of the process (code+data+stack).

       Processes marked <defunct> are dead processes (so-called "zombies") that remain because their parent has not destroyed them properly.  These
       processes will be destroyed by init(8) if the parent process exits.

       If the length of the username is greater than the length of the display column, the username will be truncated.  See the -o and -O formatting options
       to customize length.

       Commands options such as ps -aux are not recommended as it is a confusion of two different standards.  According to the POSIX and UNIX standards, the
       above command asks to display all processes with a TTY (generally the commands users are running) plus all processes owned by a user named "x".  If
       that user doesn't exist, then ps will assume you really meant "ps aux".

PROCESS FLAGS
       The sum of these values is displayed in the "F" column, which is provided by the flags output specifier:

               1    forked but didn't exec
               4    used super-user privileges

PROCESS STATE CODES
       Here are the different values that the s, stat and state output specifiers (header "STAT" or "S") will display to describe the state of a process:

               D    uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
               I    Idle kernel thread
               R    running or runnable (on run queue)
               S    interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
               T    stopped by job control signal
               t    stopped by debugger during the tracing
               W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
               X    dead (should never be seen)
               Z    defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent

       For BSD formats and when the stat keyword is used, additional characters may be displayed:

               <    high-priority (not nice to other users)
               N    low-priority (nice to other users)
               L    has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
               s    is a session leader
               l    is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do)
               +    is in the foreground process group

OBSOLETE SORT KEYS
       These keys are used by the BSD O option (when it is used for sorting).  The GNU --sort option doesn't use these keys, but the specifiers described
       below in the STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS section.  Note that the values used in sorting are the internal values ps uses and not the "cooked" values
       used in some of the output format fields (e.g.  sorting on tty will sort into device number, not according to the terminal name displayed).  Pipe ps
       output into the sort(1) command if you want to sort the cooked values.

AIX FORMAT DESCRIPTORS
       This ps supports AIX format descriptors, which work somewhat like the formatting codes of printf(1) and printf(3).  For example, the normal default
       output can be produced with this: ps -eo "%p %y %x %c".  The NORMAL codes are described in the next section.

STANDARD FORMAT SPECIFIERS
       Here are the different keywords that may be used to control the output format (e.g., with option -o) or to sort the selected processes with the
       GNU-style --sort option.

       For example: ps -eo pid,user,args --sort user

       This version of ps tries to recognize most of the keywords used in other implementations of ps.

       The following user-defined format specifiers may contain spaces: args, cmd, comm, command, fname, ucmd, ucomm, lstart, bsdstart, start.

       Some keywords may not be available for sorting.

       CODE        HEADER    DESCRIPTION

       %cpu        %CPU      cpu utilization of the process in "##.#" format.  Currently, it is the CPU time used divided by the time the process has been
                             running (cputime/realtime ratio), expressed as a percentage.  It will not add up to 100% unless you are lucky.  (alias pcpu).

       %mem        %MEM      ratio of the process's resident set size  to the physical memory on the machine, expressed as a percentage.  (alias pmem).

       args        COMMAND   command with all its arguments as a string.  Modifications to the arguments may be shown.  The output in this column may
                             contain spaces.  A process marked <defunct> is partly dead, waiting to be fully destroyed by its parent.  Sometimes the process
                             args will be unavailable; when this happens, ps will instead print the executable name in brackets.  (alias cmd, command).  See
                             also the comm format keyword, the -f option, and the c option.
                             When specified last, this column will extend to the edge of the display.  If ps can not determine display width, as when output
                             is redirected (piped) into a file or another command, the output width is undefined (it may be 80, unlimited, determined by the
                             TERM variable, and so on).  The COLUMNS environment variable or --cols option may be used to exactly determine the width in
                             this case.  The w or -w option may be also be used to adjust width.

       blocked     BLOCKED   mask of the blocked signals, see signal(7).  According to the width of the field, a 32 or 64-bit mask in hexadecimal format is
                             displayed.  (alias sig_block, sigmask).

       bsdstart    START     time the command started.  If the process was started less than 24 hours ago, the output format is " HH:MM", else it is "
                             Mmm:SS" (where Mmm is the three letters of the month).  See also lstart, start, start_time, and stime.

       bsdtime     TIME      accumulated cpu time, user + system.  The display format is usually "MMM:SS", but can be shifted to the right if the process
                             used more than 999 minutes of cpu time.

       c           C         processor utilization.  Currently, this is the integer value of the percent usage over the lifetime of the process.  (see
                             %cpu).

       caught      CAUGHT    mask of the caught signals, see signal(7).  According to the width of the field, a 32 or 64 bits mask in hexadecimal format is
                             displayed.  (alias sig_catch, sigcatch).

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The following environment variables could affect ps:

       COLUMNS
          Override default display width.

       LINES
          Override default display height.

       PS_PERSONALITY
          Set to one of posix, old, linux, bsd, sun, digital... (see section PERSONALITY below).

       CMD_ENV
          Set to one of posix, old, linux, bsd, sun, digital... (see section PERSONALITY below).

       I_WANT_A_BROKEN_PS
          Force obsolete command line interpretation.

       LC_TIME
          Date format.

       PS_COLORS
          Not currently supported.

       PS_FORMAT
          Default output format override.  You may set this to a format string of the type used for the -o option.  The DefSysV and DefBSD values are
          particularly useful.

       POSIXLY_CORRECT
          Don't find excuses to ignore bad "features".

       POSIX2
          When set to "on", acts as POSIXLY_CORRECT.

       UNIX95
          Don't find excuses to ignore bad "features".

       _XPG
          Cancel CMD_ENV=irix non-standard behavior.

       In general, it is a bad idea to set these variables.  The one exception is CMD_ENV or PS_PERSONALITY, which could be set to Linux for normal systems.
       Without that setting, ps follows the useless and bad parts of the Unix98 standard.

AUTHOR
       ps was originally written by Branko Lankester ⟨lankeste@fwi.uva.nl⟩.  Michael K. Johnson ⟨johnsonm@redhat.com⟩ re-wrote it significantly to use the
       proc filesystem, changing a few things in the process.  Michael Shields ⟨mjshield@nyx.cs.du.edu⟩ added the pid-list feature.  Charles Blake ⟨cblake@
       bbn.com⟩ added multi-level sorting, the dirent-style library, the device name-to-number mmaped database, the approximate binary search directly on
       System.map, and many code and documentation cleanups.  David Mossberger-Tang wrote the generic BFD support for psupdate.  Albert Cahalan ⟨albert@

NAME
       man - an interface to the system reference manuals

SYNOPSIS
       man [man options] [[section] page ...] ...
       man -k [apropos options] regexp ...
       man -K [man options] [section] term ...
       man -f [whatis options] page ...
       man -l [man options] file ...
       man -w|-W [man options] page ...

DESCRIPTION
       man  is  the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associ‐
       ated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of  the  manual.
       The default action is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found,
       even if page exists in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE, ERRORS, ENVIRONMENT,  FILES,  VER‐
       SIONS, CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact  rendering  may  vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render italics when running in a terminal,
       and will typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable  to  illustrate  several
       exclusive invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

       man man.7
           Display the manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is an alternative spelling of "man 7 man".)

       man 'man(7)'
           Display  the  manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is another alternative spelling of "man 7 man".  It may be more convenient
           when copying and pasting cross-references to manual pages.  Note that the parentheses must normally be quoted to protect them from the shell.)

       man -a intro
           Display, in succession, all of the available intro manual pages contained within the manual.  It is possible to quit between successive  displays
           or skip any of them.

       man -t bash | lpr -Pps
           Format the manual page for bash into the default troff or groff format and pipe it to the printer named ps.  The default output for groff is usu‐
           ally PostScript.  man --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.

       man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a device independent (dvi) file.  The redirection is neces‐
           sary as the -T flag causes output to be directed to stdout with no pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi or further pro‐
           cessed into PostScript using a program such as dvips.

       man -k printf
           Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.  Print out any matches.   Equivalent  to  apro‐
           pos printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short descriptions of any found.  Equivalent to whatis smail.

OVERVIEW
       Many  options are available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes can be made to the search path, section or‐
       der, output processor, and other behaviours and operations detailed below.

       If set, various environment variables are interrogated to determine the operation of man.  It is possible to set the "catch-all" variable $MANOPT  to
       any string in command line format, with the exception that any spaces used as part of an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).
       man will parse $MANOPT prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options requiring an argument will be overridden by the same  options  found  on
       the  command line.  To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be specified as the initial command line option.  This will allow man to "for‐
       get" about the options specified in $MANOPT, although they must still have been valid.

       Manual pages are normally stored in nroff(1) format under a directory such as /usr/share/man.  In some installations, there may also be  preformatted
       cat pages to improve performance.  See manpath(5) for details of where these files are stored.

       This  package supports manual pages in multiple languages, controlled by your locale.  If your system did not set this up for you automatically, then
       you may need to set $LC_MESSAGES, $LANG, or another system-dependent environment variable to indicate your preferred locale, usually specified in the
       POSIX format:

       <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your locale, it will be displayed in lieu of the standard (usually American English) page.

       If you find that the translations supplied with this package are not available in your native language and you would like to supply them, please con‐
       tact the maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.

       Individual manual pages are normally written and maintained by the maintainers of the program, function, or other topic that they document,  and  are
       not  included  with  this  package.  If you find that a manual page is missing or inadequate, please report that to the maintainers of the package in
       question.

       For information regarding other features and extensions available with this manual pager, please read the documents supplied with the package.

DEFAULTS
       The order of sections to search may be overridden by the environment variable $MANSECT or by the SECTION directive in  /etc/manpath.config.   By  de‐
       fault it is as follows:

              1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7

       The  formatted manual page is displayed using a pager.  This can be specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default (see option -P
       for details).

       The filters are deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line option -p or the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is interrogated.  If -p
       was  not  used  and the environment variable was not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain a valid
       preprocessor string, the first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A formatting pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable
       program  mandb_nfmt  (or  mandb_tfmt  with  -t) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets passed the manual source file, the pre‐
       processor string, and optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non-argument options that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both, are not harmful.  For options  that  require  an  argument,
       each duplication will override the previous argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
              This option is normally issued as the very first option and resets man's behaviour to its default.  Its use is to reset those options that may
              have been set in $MANOPT.  Any options that follow -D will have their usual effect.

       --warnings[=warnings]
              Enable warnings from groff.  This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of manual pages.  warnings is a comma-separated list
              of warning names; if it is not supplied, the default is "mac".  See the “Warnings” node in info groff for a list of available warning names.

   Main modes of operation
       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent to whatis.  Display a short description from the manual page, if available.  See whatis(1) for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1) for details.

       -K, --global-apropos
              Search  for text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time; if you can, you should specify a section
              to reduce the number of pages that need to be searched.  Search terms may be simple strings (the  default),  or  regular  expressions  if  the
              --regex option is used.

              Note that this searches the sources of the manual pages, not the rendered text, and so may include false positives due to things like comments
              in source files.  Searching the rendered text would be much slower.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate "local" mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching through the system's manual collection.  Each  manual  page
              argument  will  be  interpreted as an nroff source file in the correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the argu‐
              ments, input will be taken from stdin.  When this option is not used, and man fails to find the page required,  before  displaying  the  error
              message, it attempts to act as if this option was supplied, using the name as a filename and looking for an exact match.

       -w, --where, --path, --location
              Don't  actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the source nroff file that would be formatted.  If the -a option is also
              used, then print the locations of all source files that match the search criteria.

       -W, --where-cat, --location-cat
              Don't actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the preformatted cat file that would be displayed.  If the -a  option  is
              also used, then print the locations of all preformatted cat files that match the search criteria.

              If  -w  and  -W are both used, then print both source file and cat file separated by a space.  If all of -w, -W, and -a are used, then do this
              for each possible match.

       -c, --catman
              This option is not for general use and should only be used by the catman program.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead of formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the specified encoding.  If you already know the encod‐
              ing of the source file, you can also use manconv(1) directly.  However, this option allows you to convert several manual pages to a single en‐
              coding without having to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they were already installed in a structure similar to  a  manual
              page hierarchy.

              Consider  using  man-recode(1) instead for converting multiple manual pages, since it has an interface designed for bulk conversion and so can
              be much faster.

   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              man will normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which  interrogates  various  environment  variables,
              possibly  including  $LC_MESSAGES and $LANG.  To temporarily override the determined value, use this option to supply a locale string directly
              to man.  Note that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such as the help message will  always  be  dis‐
              played in the initially determined locale.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If  this system has access to other operating system's manual pages, they can be accessed using this option.  To search for a manual page from
              NewOS's manual page collection, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include a search of  the  native  operating  system's
              manual pages, include the system name man in the argument string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify  an  alternate  manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath derived code to determine the path to search.  This option overrides the
              $MANPATH environment variable and causes option -m to be ignored.

              A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into sections as described in the  man-db  manual  (under
              "The manual page system").  To view manual pages outside such hierarchies, see the -l option.

       -S list, -s list, --sections=list
              The given list is a colon- or comma-separated list of sections, used to determine which manual sections to search and in what order.  This op‐
              tion overrides the $MANSECT environment variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility with System V.)

       -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension
              Some systems incorporate large packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the Tcl package, into the main  manual  page  hierarchy.
              To get around the problem of having two manual pages with the same name such as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to section l.
              As this is unfortunate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and to assign a specific  "extension"  to  them,  in  this
              case,  exit(3tcl).   Under  normal  operation, man will display exit(3) in preference to exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and to avoid
              having to know which section the page you require resides in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string indicating  which  package
              the page must belong to.  Using the above example, supplying the option -e tcl to man will restrict the search to pages having an extension of
              *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       --regex
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument as a regular expression,  as  with  apro‐
              pos(1).  Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a regular expression, this option implies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show  all  pages  with  any  part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument using shell-style wildcards, as with
              apropos(1) --wildcard.  The page argument must match the entire name or description, or match on word boundaries in  the  description.   Since
              there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a wildcard, this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If the --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names, not page descriptions, as with whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By  default,  man  will  exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.  Using this option forces man to display all the manual
              pages with names that match the search criteria.

       -u, --update
              This option causes man to update its database caches of installed manual pages.  This is only needed in rare situations, and  it  is  normally
              better to run mandb(8) instead.

       --no-subpages
              By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the command line as equivalent to a single manual page name contain‐
              ing a hyphen or an underscore.  This supports the common pattern of programs that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to  provide
              manual pages for each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to invoke the subcommands themselves.  For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify  which  output pager to use.  By default, man uses pager, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.  This option
              overrides the $MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is not used in conjunction with  -f
              or -k.

              The  value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).
              It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an ar‐
              gument or on standard input.

       -r prompt, --prompt=prompt
              If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to set its prompt and some sensible options.  The default prompt looks like

               Manual page name(sec) line x

              where  name denotes the manual page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x the current line number.  This is achieved by using
              the $LESS environment variable.

              Supplying -r with a string will override this default.  The string may contain the text $MAN_PN which will be expanded to the name of the cur‐
              rent manual page and its section name surrounded by "(" and ")".  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              \ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:
              byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..
              (press h for help or q to quit)

              It is broken into three lines here for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the less(1) manual page.  The prompt string is first
              evaluated by the shell.  All double quotes, back-quotes and backslashes in the prompt must be escaped by a preceding  backslash.   The  prompt
              string may end in an escaped $ which may be followed by further options for less.  By default man sets the -ix8 options.

              The $MANLESS environment variable described below may be used to set a default prompt string if none is supplied on the command line.

       -7, --ascii
              When  viewing  a  pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may not display correctly when using the
              latin1(7) device description with GNU nroff.  This option allows pure ascii manual pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1 device.   It
              will  not  translate  any  latin1 text.  The following table shows the translations performed: some parts of it may only be displayed properly
              when using GNU nroff's latin1(7) device.

              Description           Octal   latin1   ascii
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────
              continuation hyphen    255      ‐        -
              bullet (middle dot)    267      •        o
              acute accent           264      ´        '
              multiplication sign    327      ×        x

              If the latin1 column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters and this option is not necessary.   If  the  latin1
              and  ascii columns are identical, you are reading this page using this option or man did not format this page using the latin1 device descrip‐
              tion.  If the latin1 column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual pages with this option.

              This option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for nroff other than GNU's.

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward compatibility, encoding may be an nroff device such  as  ascii,
              latin1, or utf8 as well as a true character encoding such as UTF-8.

       --no-hyphenation, --nh
              Normally, nroff will automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not contain hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to lay
              out words on a line without excessive spacing.  This option disables automatic hyphenation, so words will only be hyphenated if  they  already
              contain hyphens.

              If  you  are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at an inappropriate point, do not use this option,
              but consult the nroff documentation instead; for instance, you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at that point,
              or put "\%" at the start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.

       --no-justification, --nj
              Normally,  nroff will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full justification, leaving justified only to the left
              margin, sometimes called "ragged-right" text.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain paragraphs, do not use this option, but consult  the
              nroff  documentation instead; for instance, you can use the ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting and fill‐
              ing.

       -p string, --preprocessor=string
              Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff/groff.  Not all installations will have a full set of preprocessors.   Some
              of  the  preprocessors  and  the  letters used to designate them are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer (r).  This option
              overrides the $MANROFFSEQ environment variable.  zsoelim is always run as the very first preprocessor.

       -t, --troff
              Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This option is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to be suitable for a device other than the default.  It implies -t.  Examples
              (provided with Groff-1.17) include dvi, latin1, ps, utf8, X75 and X100.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This  option  will  cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web browser.  The choice of browser is determined by
              the optional browser argument if one is provided, by the $BROWSER environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually
              lynx).  This option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.

       -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]
              This option displays the output of groff in a graphical window using the gxditview program.  The dpi (dots per inch) may be 75, 75-12, 100, or
              100-12, defaulting to 75; the -12 variants use a 12-point base font.  This option implies -T with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device re‐
              spectively.

       -Z, --ditroff
              groff  will run troff and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for the chosen device.  If groff -mandoc is groff,
              this option is passed to groff and will suppress the use of a post-processor.  It implies -t.

   Getting help
       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

       MANROFFOPT
              Every time man invokes the formatter (nroff, troff, or groff), it adds the contents of $MANROFFOPT to the formatter's command line.

       MANROFFSEQ
              If $MANROFFSEQ is set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors to pass each manual page  through.   The  default  preprocessor
              list is system dependent.

       MANSECT
              If  $MANSECT  is  set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and it is used to determine which manual sections to search and in what
              order.  The default is "1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7", unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              If $MANPAGER or $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its value is used as the name of the program used to display the manual page.
              By default, pager is used, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.

              The  value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).
              It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an ar‐
              gument or on standard input.

       MANLESS
              If  $MANLESS  is set, its value will be used as the default prompt string for the less pager, as if it had been passed using the -r option (so
              any occurrences of the text $MAN_PN will be expanded in the same way).  For example, if you want to set the prompt string  unconditionally  to
              “my prompt string”, set $MANLESS to ‘-Psmy prompt string’.  Using the -r option overrides this environment variable.

       BROWSER
              If  $BROWSER  is  set,  its  value  is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a web browser for man
              --html.  In each command, %s is replaced by a filename containing the HTML output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and
              %c is replaced by a colon (:).

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m option.

       MANOPT If  $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to be in a similar format.  As all of the other man specific
              environment variables can be expressed as command line options, and are thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is expected that they
              will become obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that should be interpreted as part of an option's argument must be escaped.

       MANWIDTH
              If  $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be formatted.  If it is not set, manual pages will be
              formatted with a line length appropriate to the current terminal (using the value of $COLUMNS, and ioctl(2) if available, or falling  back  to
              80  characters if neither is available).  Cat pages will only be saved when the default formatting can be used, that is when the terminal line
              length is between 66 and 80 characters.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              Normally, when output is not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are discarded to make it easier
              to read the result without special tools.  However, if $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING is set to any non-empty value, these formatting characters are re‐
              tained.  This may be useful for wrappers around man that can interpret formatting characters.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              Normally, when output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a pager), any error output from the command used to produce  formatted  ver‐
              sions of manual pages is discarded to avoid interfering with the pager's display.  Programs such as groff often produce relatively minor error
              messages about typographical problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally confusing when displayed along with the manual
              page.   However,  some users want to see them anyway, so, if $MAN_KEEP_STDERR is set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed as
              usual.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              Depending on system and implementation, either or both of $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated for the  current  message  locale.   man
              will display its messages in that locale (if available).  See setlocale(3) for precise details.

FILES
       /etc/manpath.config
              man-db configuration file.

       /usr/share/man

NAME
       man - an interface to the system reference manuals

SYNOPSIS
       man [man options] [[section] page ...] ...
       man -k [apropos options] regexp ...
       man -K [man options] [section] term ...
       man -f [whatis options] page ...
       man -l [man options] file ...
       man -w|-W [man options] page ...

DESCRIPTION
       man  is  the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associ‐
       ated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of  the  manual.
       The default action is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found,
       even if page exists in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE, ERRORS, ENVIRONMENT,  FILES,  VER‐
       SIONS, CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact  rendering  may  vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render italics when running in a terminal,
       and will typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable  to  illustrate  several
       exclusive invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

       man man.7
           Display the manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is an alternative spelling of "man 7 man".)

       man 'man(7)'
           Display  the  manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is another alternative spelling of "man 7 man".  It may be more convenient
           when copying and pasting cross-references to manual pages.  Note that the parentheses must normally be quoted to protect them from the shell.)

       man -a intro
           Display, in succession, all of the available intro manual pages contained within the manual.  It is possible to quit between successive  displays
           or skip any of them.

       man -t bash | lpr -Pps
           Format the manual page for bash into the default troff or groff format and pipe it to the printer named ps.  The default output for groff is usu‐
           ally PostScript.  man --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.

       man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a device independent (dvi) file.  The redirection is neces‐
           sary as the -T flag causes output to be directed to stdout with no pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi or further pro‐
           cessed into PostScript using a program such as dvips.

       man -k printf
           Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.  Print out any matches.   Equivalent  to  apro‐
           pos printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short descriptions of any found.  Equivalent to whatis smail.

OVERVIEW
       Many  options are available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes can be made to the search path, section or‐
       der, output processor, and other behaviours and operations detailed below.

       If set, various environment variables are interrogated to determine the operation of man.  It is possible to set the "catch-all" variable $MANOPT  to
       any string in command line format, with the exception that any spaces used as part of an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).
       man will parse $MANOPT prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options requiring an argument will be overridden by the same  options  found  on
       the  command line.  To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be specified as the initial command line option.  This will allow man to "for‐
       get" about the options specified in $MANOPT, although they must still have been valid.

       Manual pages are normally stored in nroff(1) format under a directory such as /usr/share/man.  In some installations, there may also be  preformatted
       cat pages to improve performance.  See manpath(5) for details of where these files are stored.

       This  package supports manual pages in multiple languages, controlled by your locale.  If your system did not set this up for you automatically, then
       you may need to set $LC_MESSAGES, $LANG, or another system-dependent environment variable to indicate your preferred locale, usually specified in the
       POSIX format:

       <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your locale, it will be displayed in lieu of the standard (usually American English) page.

       If you find that the translations supplied with this package are not available in your native language and you would like to supply them, please con‐
       tact the maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.

       Individual manual pages are normally written and maintained by the maintainers of the program, function, or other topic that they document,  and  are
       not  included  with  this  package.  If you find that a manual page is missing or inadequate, please report that to the maintainers of the package in
       question.

       For information regarding other features and extensions available with this manual pager, please read the documents supplied with the package.

DEFAULTS
       The order of sections to search may be overridden by the environment variable $MANSECT or by the SECTION directive in  /etc/manpath.config.   By  de‐
       fault it is as follows:

              1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7

       The  formatted manual page is displayed using a pager.  This can be specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default (see option -P
       for details).

       The filters are deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line option -p or the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is interrogated.  If -p
       was  not  used  and the environment variable was not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain a valid
       preprocessor string, the first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A formatting pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable
       program  mandb_nfmt  (or  mandb_tfmt  with  -t) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets passed the manual source file, the pre‐
       processor string, and optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non-argument options that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both, are not harmful.  For options  that  require  an  argument,
       each duplication will override the previous argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
              This option is normally issued as the very first option and resets man's behaviour to its default.  Its use is to reset those options that may
              have been set in $MANOPT.  Any options that follow -D will have their usual effect.

       --warnings[=warnings]
              Enable warnings from groff.  This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of manual pages.  warnings is a comma-separated list
              of warning names; if it is not supplied, the default is "mac".  See the “Warnings” node in info groff for a list of available warning names.

   Main modes of operation
       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent to whatis.  Display a short description from the manual page, if available.  See whatis(1) for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1) for details.

       -K, --global-apropos
              Search  for text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time; if you can, you should specify a section
              to reduce the number of pages that need to be searched.  Search terms may be simple strings (the  default),  or  regular  expressions  if  the
              --regex option is used.

              Note that this searches the sources of the manual pages, not the rendered text, and so may include false positives due to things like comments
              in source files.  Searching the rendered text would be much slower.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate "local" mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching through the system's manual collection.  Each  manual  page
              argument  will  be  interpreted as an nroff source file in the correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the argu‐
              ments, input will be taken from stdin.  When this option is not used, and man fails to find the page required,  before  displaying  the  error
              message, it attempts to act as if this option was supplied, using the name as a filename and looking for an exact match.

       -w, --where, --path, --location
              Don't  actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the source nroff file that would be formatted.  If the -a option is also
              used, then print the locations of all source files that match the search criteria.

       -W, --where-cat, --location-cat
              Don't actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the preformatted cat file that would be displayed.  If the -a  option  is
              also used, then print the locations of all preformatted cat files that match the search criteria.

              If  -w  and  -W are both used, then print both source file and cat file separated by a space.  If all of -w, -W, and -a are used, then do this
              for each possible match.

       -c, --catman
              This option is not for general use and should only be used by the catman program.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead of formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the specified encoding.  If you already know the encod‐
              ing of the source file, you can also use manconv(1) directly.  However, this option allows you to convert several manual pages to a single en‐
              coding without having to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they were already installed in a structure similar to  a  manual
              page hierarchy.

              Consider  using  man-recode(1) instead for converting multiple manual pages, since it has an interface designed for bulk conversion and so can
              be much faster.

   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              man will normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which  interrogates  various  environment  variables,
              possibly  including  $LC_MESSAGES and $LANG.  To temporarily override the determined value, use this option to supply a locale string directly
              to man.  Note that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such as the help message will  always  be  dis‐
              played in the initially determined locale.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If  this system has access to other operating system's manual pages, they can be accessed using this option.  To search for a manual page from
              NewOS's manual page collection, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include a search of  the  native  operating  system's
              manual pages, include the system name man in the argument string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify  an  alternate  manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath derived code to determine the path to search.  This option overrides the
              $MANPATH environment variable and causes option -m to be ignored.

              A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into sections as described in the  man-db  manual  (under
              "The manual page system").  To view manual pages outside such hierarchies, see the -l option.

       -S list, -s list, --sections=list
              The given list is a colon- or comma-separated list of sections, used to determine which manual sections to search and in what order.  This op‐
              tion overrides the $MANSECT environment variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility with System V.)

       -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension
              Some systems incorporate large packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the Tcl package, into the main  manual  page  hierarchy.
              To get around the problem of having two manual pages with the same name such as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to section l.
              As this is unfortunate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and to assign a specific  "extension"  to  them,  in  this
              case,  exit(3tcl).   Under  normal  operation, man will display exit(3) in preference to exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and to avoid
              having to know which section the page you require resides in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string indicating  which  package
              the page must belong to.  Using the above example, supplying the option -e tcl to man will restrict the search to pages having an extension of
              *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       --regex
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument as a regular expression,  as  with  apro‐
              pos(1).  Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a regular expression, this option implies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show  all  pages  with  any  part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument using shell-style wildcards, as with
              apropos(1) --wildcard.  The page argument must match the entire name or description, or match on word boundaries in  the  description.   Since
              there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a wildcard, this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If the --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names, not page descriptions, as with whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By  default,  man  will  exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.  Using this option forces man to display all the manual
              pages with names that match the search criteria.

       -u, --update
              This option causes man to update its database caches of installed manual pages.  This is only needed in rare situations, and  it  is  normally
              better to run mandb(8) instead.

       --no-subpages
              By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the command line as equivalent to a single manual page name contain‐
              ing a hyphen or an underscore.  This supports the common pattern of programs that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to  provide
              manual pages for each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to invoke the subcommands themselves.  For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify  which  output pager to use.  By default, man uses pager, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.  This option
              overrides the $MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is not used in conjunction with  -f
              or -k.

              The  value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).
              It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an ar‐
              gument or on standard input.

       -r prompt, --prompt=prompt
              If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to set its prompt and some sensible options.  The default prompt looks like

               Manual page name(sec) line x

              where  name denotes the manual page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x the current line number.  This is achieved by using
              the $LESS environment variable.

              Supplying -r with a string will override this default.  The string may contain the text $MAN_PN which will be expanded to the name of the cur‐
              rent manual page and its section name surrounded by "(" and ")".  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              \ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:
              byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..
              (press h for help or q to quit)

              It is broken into three lines here for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the less(1) manual page.  The prompt string is first
              evaluated by the shell.  All double quotes, back-quotes and backslashes in the prompt must be escaped by a preceding  backslash.   The  prompt
              string may end in an escaped $ which may be followed by further options for less.  By default man sets the -ix8 options.

              The $MANLESS environment variable described below may be used to set a default prompt string if none is supplied on the command line.

       -7, --ascii
              When  viewing  a  pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may not display correctly when using the
              latin1(7) device description with GNU nroff.  This option allows pure ascii manual pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1 device.   It
              will  not  translate  any  latin1 text.  The following table shows the translations performed: some parts of it may only be displayed properly
              when using GNU nroff's latin1(7) device.

              Description           Octal   latin1   ascii
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────
              continuation hyphen    255      ‐        -
              bullet (middle dot)    267      •        o
              acute accent           264      ´        '
              multiplication sign    327      ×        x

              If the latin1 column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters and this option is not necessary.   If  the  latin1
              and  ascii columns are identical, you are reading this page using this option or man did not format this page using the latin1 device descrip‐
              tion.  If the latin1 column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual pages with this option.

              This option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for nroff other than GNU's.

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward compatibility, encoding may be an nroff device such  as  ascii,
              latin1, or utf8 as well as a true character encoding such as UTF-8.

       --no-hyphenation, --nh
              Normally, nroff will automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not contain hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to lay
              out words on a line without excessive spacing.  This option disables automatic hyphenation, so words will only be hyphenated if  they  already
              contain hyphens.

              If  you  are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at an inappropriate point, do not use this option,
              but consult the nroff documentation instead; for instance, you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at that point,
              or put "\%" at the start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.

       --no-justification, --nj
              Normally,  nroff will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full justification, leaving justified only to the left
              margin, sometimes called "ragged-right" text.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain paragraphs, do not use this option, but consult  the
              nroff  documentation instead; for instance, you can use the ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting and fill‐
              ing.

       -p string, --preprocessor=string
              Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff/groff.  Not all installations will have a full set of preprocessors.   Some
              of  the  preprocessors  and  the  letters used to designate them are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer (r).  This option
              overrides the $MANROFFSEQ environment variable.  zsoelim is always run as the very first preprocessor.

       -t, --troff
              Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This option is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to be suitable for a device other than the default.  It implies -t.  Examples
              (provided with Groff-1.17) include dvi, latin1, ps, utf8, X75 and X100.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This  option  will  cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web browser.  The choice of browser is determined by
              the optional browser argument if one is provided, by the $BROWSER environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually
              lynx).  This option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.

       -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]
              This option displays the output of groff in a graphical window using the gxditview program.  The dpi (dots per inch) may be 75, 75-12, 100, or
              100-12, defaulting to 75; the -12 variants use a 12-point base font.  This option implies -T with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device re‐
              spectively.

       -Z, --ditroff
              groff  will run troff and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for the chosen device.  If groff -mandoc is groff,
              this option is passed to groff and will suppress the use of a post-processor.  It implies -t.

   Getting help
       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

       MANROFFOPT
              Every time man invokes the formatter (nroff, troff, or groff), it adds the contents of $MANROFFOPT to the formatter's command line.

       MANROFFSEQ
              If $MANROFFSEQ is set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors to pass each manual page  through.   The  default  preprocessor
              list is system dependent.

       MANSECT
              If  $MANSECT  is  set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and it is used to determine which manual sections to search and in what
              order.  The default is "1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7", unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              If $MANPAGER or $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its value is used as the name of the program used to display the manual page.
              By default, pager is used, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.

              The  value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).
              It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an ar‐
              gument or on standard input.

       MANLESS
              If  $MANLESS  is set, its value will be used as the default prompt string for the less pager, as if it had been passed using the -r option (so
              any occurrences of the text $MAN_PN will be expanded in the same way).  For example, if you want to set the prompt string  unconditionally  to
              “my prompt string”, set $MANLESS to ‘-Psmy prompt string’.  Using the -r option overrides this environment variable.

       BROWSER
              If  $BROWSER  is  set,  its  value  is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a web browser for man
              --html.  In each command, %s is replaced by a filename containing the HTML output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and
              %c is replaced by a colon (:).

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m option.

       MANOPT If  $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to be in a similar format.  As all of the other man specific
              environment variables can be expressed as command line options, and are thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is expected that they
              will become obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that should be interpreted as part of an option's argument must be escaped.

       MANWIDTH
              If  $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be formatted.  If it is not set, manual pages will be
              formatted with a line length appropriate to the current terminal (using the value of $COLUMNS, and ioctl(2) if available, or falling  back  to
              80  characters if neither is available).  Cat pages will only be saved when the default formatting can be used, that is when the terminal line
              length is between 66 and 80 characters.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              Normally, when output is not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are discarded to make it easier
              to read the result without special tools.  However, if $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING is set to any non-empty value, these formatting characters are re‐
              tained.  This may be useful for wrappers around man that can interpret formatting characters.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              Normally, when output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a pager), any error output from the command used to produce  formatted  ver‐
              sions of manual pages is discarded to avoid interfering with the pager's display.  Programs such as groff often produce relatively minor error
              messages about typographical problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally confusing when displayed along with the manual
              page.   However,  some users want to see them anyway, so, if $MAN_KEEP_STDERR is set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed as
              usual.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              Depending on system and implementation, either or both of $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated for the  current  message  locale.   man
              will display its messages in that locale (if available).  See setlocale(3) for precise details.

NAME
       man - an interface to the system reference manuals

SYNOPSIS
       man [man options] [[section] page ...] ...
       man -k [apropos options] regexp ...
       man -K [man options] [section] term ...
       man -f [whatis options] page ...
       man -l [man options] file ...
       man -w|-W [man options] page ...

DESCRIPTION
       man  is  the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associ‐
       ated with each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of  the  manual.
       The default action is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found,
       even if page exists in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE, ERRORS, ENVIRONMENT,  FILES,  VER‐
       SIONS, CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact  rendering  may  vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render italics when running in a terminal,
       and will typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable  to  illustrate  several
       exclusive invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

       man man.7
           Display the manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is an alternative spelling of "man 7 man".)

       man 'man(7)'
           Display  the  manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is another alternative spelling of "man 7 man".  It may be more convenient
           when copying and pasting cross-references to manual pages.  Note that the parentheses must normally be quoted to protect them from the shell.)

       man -a intro
           Display, in succession, all of the available intro manual pages contained within the manual.  It is possible to quit between successive  displays
           or skip any of them.

       man -t bash | lpr -Pps
           Format the manual page for bash into the default troff or groff format and pipe it to the printer named ps.  The default output for groff is usu‐
           ally PostScript.  man --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.

       man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a device independent (dvi) file.  The redirection is neces‐
           sary as the -T flag causes output to be directed to stdout with no pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi or further pro‐
           cessed into PostScript using a program such as dvips.

       man -k printf
           Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.  Print out any matches.   Equivalent  to  apro‐
           pos printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short descriptions of any found.  Equivalent to whatis smail.

OVERVIEW
       Many  options are available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes can be made to the search path, section or‐
       der, output processor, and other behaviours and operations detailed below.

       If set, various environment variables are interrogated to determine the operation of man.  It is possible to set the "catch-all" variable $MANOPT  to
       any string in command line format, with the exception that any spaces used as part of an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).
       man will parse $MANOPT prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options requiring an argument will be overridden by the same  options  found  on
       the  command line.  To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be specified as the initial command line option.  This will allow man to "for‐
       get" about the options specified in $MANOPT, although they must still have been valid.

       Manual pages are normally stored in nroff(1) format under a directory such as /usr/share/man.  In some installations, there may also be  preformatted
       cat pages to improve performance.  See manpath(5) for details of where these files are stored.

       This  package supports manual pages in multiple languages, controlled by your locale.  If your system did not set this up for you automatically, then
       you may need to set $LC_MESSAGES, $LANG, or another system-dependent environment variable to indicate your preferred locale, usually specified in the
       POSIX format:

       <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your locale, it will be displayed in lieu of the standard (usually American English) page.

       If you find that the translations supplied with this package are not available in your native language and you would like to supply them, please con‐
       tact the maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.

       Individual manual pages are normally written and maintained by the maintainers of the program, function, or other topic that they document,  and  are
       not  included  with  this  package.  If you find that a manual page is missing or inadequate, please report that to the maintainers of the package in
       question.

       For information regarding other features and extensions available with this manual pager, please read the documents supplied with the package.

DEFAULTS
       The order of sections to search may be overridden by the environment variable $MANSECT or by the SECTION directive in  /etc/manpath.config.   By  de‐
       fault it is as follows:

              1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7

       The  formatted manual page is displayed using a pager.  This can be specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default (see option -P
       for details).

       The filters are deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line option -p or the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is interrogated.  If -p
       was  not  used  and the environment variable was not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain a valid
       preprocessor string, the first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A formatting pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable
       program  mandb_nfmt  (or  mandb_tfmt  with  -t) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets passed the manual source file, the pre‐
       processor string, and optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non-argument options that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both, are not harmful.  For options  that  require  an  argument,
       each duplication will override the previous argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
              This option is normally issued as the very first option and resets man's behaviour to its default.  Its use is to reset those options that may
              have been set in $MANOPT.  Any options that follow -D will have their usual effect.

       --warnings[=warnings]
              Enable warnings from groff.  This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of manual pages.  warnings is a comma-separated list
              of warning names; if it is not supplied, the default is "mac".  See the “Warnings” node in info groff for a list of available warning names.

   Main modes of operation
       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent to whatis.  Display a short description from the manual page, if available.  See whatis(1) for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1) for details.

       -K, --global-apropos
              Search  for text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time; if you can, you should specify a section
              to reduce the number of pages that need to be searched.  Search terms may be simple strings (the  default),  or  regular  expressions  if  the
              --regex option is used.

              Note that this searches the sources of the manual pages, not the rendered text, and so may include false positives due to things like comments
              in source files.  Searching the rendered text would be much slower.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate "local" mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching through the system's manual collection.  Each  manual  page
              argument  will  be  interpreted as an nroff source file in the correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the argu‐
              ments, input will be taken from stdin.  When this option is not used, and man fails to find the page required,  before  displaying  the  error
              message, it attempts to act as if this option was supplied, using the name as a filename and looking for an exact match.

       -w, --where, --path, --location
              Don't  actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the source nroff file that would be formatted.  If the -a option is also
              used, then print the locations of all source files that match the search criteria.

       -W, --where-cat, --location-cat
              Don't actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the preformatted cat file that would be displayed.  If the -a  option  is
              also used, then print the locations of all preformatted cat files that match the search criteria.

              If  -w  and  -W are both used, then print both source file and cat file separated by a space.  If all of -w, -W, and -a are used, then do this
              for each possible match.

       -c, --catman
              This option is not for general use and should only be used by the catman program.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead of formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the specified encoding.  If you already know the encod‐
              ing of the source file, you can also use manconv(1) directly.  However, this option allows you to convert several manual pages to a single en‐
              coding without having to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they were already installed in a structure similar to  a  manual
              page hierarchy.

              Consider  using  man-recode(1) instead for converting multiple manual pages, since it has an interface designed for bulk conversion and so can
              be much faster.

   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              man will normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which  interrogates  various  environment  variables,
              possibly  including  $LC_MESSAGES and $LANG.  To temporarily override the determined value, use this option to supply a locale string directly
              to man.  Note that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such as the help message will  always  be  dis‐
              played in the initially determined locale.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If  this system has access to other operating system's manual pages, they can be accessed using this option.  To search for a manual page from
              NewOS's manual page collection, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include a search of  the  native  operating  system's
              manual pages, include the system name man in the argument string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify  an  alternate  manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath derived code to determine the path to search.  This option overrides the
              $MANPATH environment variable and causes option -m to be ignored.

              A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into sections as described in the  man-db  manual  (under
              "The manual page system").  To view manual pages outside such hierarchies, see the -l option.

       -S list, -s list, --sections=list
              The given list is a colon- or comma-separated list of sections, used to determine which manual sections to search and in what order.  This op‐
              tion overrides the $MANSECT environment variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility with System V.)

       -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension
              Some systems incorporate large packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the Tcl package, into the main  manual  page  hierarchy.
              To get around the problem of having two manual pages with the same name such as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to section l.
              As this is unfortunate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and to assign a specific  "extension"  to  them,  in  this
              case,  exit(3tcl).   Under  normal  operation, man will display exit(3) in preference to exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and to avoid
              having to know which section the page you require resides in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string indicating  which  package
              the page must belong to.  Using the above example, supplying the option -e tcl to man will restrict the search to pages having an extension of
              *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       --regex
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument as a regular expression,  as  with  apro‐
              pos(1).  Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a regular expression, this option implies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show  all  pages  with  any  part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument using shell-style wildcards, as with
              apropos(1) --wildcard.  The page argument must match the entire name or description, or match on word boundaries in  the  description.   Since
              there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a wildcard, this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If the --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names, not page descriptions, as with whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By  default,  man  will  exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.  Using this option forces man to display all the manual
              pages with names that match the search criteria.

       -u, --update
              This option causes man to update its database caches of installed manual pages.  This is only needed in rare situations, and  it  is  normally
              better to run mandb(8) instead.

       --no-subpages
              By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the command line as equivalent to a single manual page name contain‐
              ing a hyphen or an underscore.  This supports the common pattern of programs that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to  provide
              manual pages for each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to invoke the subcommands themselves.  For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify  which  output pager to use.  By default, man uses pager, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.  This option
              overrides the $MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is not used in conjunction with  -f
              or -k.

              The  value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).
              It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an ar‐
              gument or on standard input.

       -r prompt, --prompt=prompt
              If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to set its prompt and some sensible options.  The default prompt looks like

               Manual page name(sec) line x

              where  name denotes the manual page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x the current line number.  This is achieved by using
              the $LESS environment variable.

              Supplying -r with a string will override this default.  The string may contain the text $MAN_PN which will be expanded to the name of the cur‐
              rent manual page and its section name surrounded by "(" and ")".  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              \ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:
              byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..
              (press h for help or q to quit)

              It is broken into three lines here for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the less(1) manual page.  The prompt string is first
              evaluated by the shell.  All double quotes, back-quotes and backslashes in the prompt must be escaped by a preceding  backslash.   The  prompt
              string may end in an escaped $ which may be followed by further options for less.  By default man sets the -ix8 options.

              The $MANLESS environment variable described below may be used to set a default prompt string if none is supplied on the command line.

       -7, --ascii
              When  viewing  a  pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may not display correctly when using the
              latin1(7) device description with GNU nroff.  This option allows pure ascii manual pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1 device.   It
              will  not  translate  any  latin1 text.  The following table shows the translations performed: some parts of it may only be displayed properly
              when using GNU nroff's latin1(7) device.

              Description           Octal   latin1   ascii
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────
              continuation hyphen    255      ‐        -
              bullet (middle dot)    267      •        o
              acute accent           264      ´        '
              multiplication sign    327      ×        x

              If the latin1 column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters and this option is not necessary.   If  the  latin1
              and  ascii columns are identical, you are reading this page using this option or man did not format this page using the latin1 device descrip‐
              tion.  If the latin1 column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual pages with this option.

              This option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for nroff other than GNU's.

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward compatibility, encoding may be an nroff device such  as  ascii,
              latin1, or utf8 as well as a true character encoding such as UTF-8.

       --no-hyphenation, --nh
              Normally, nroff will automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not contain hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to lay
              out words on a line without excessive spacing.  This option disables automatic hyphenation, so words will only be hyphenated if  they  already
              contain hyphens.

              If  you  are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at an inappropriate point, do not use this option,
              but consult the nroff documentation instead; for instance, you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at that point,
              or put "\%" at the start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.

       --no-justification, --nj
              Normally,  nroff will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full justification, leaving justified only to the left
              margin, sometimes called "ragged-right" text.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain paragraphs, do not use this option, but consult  the
              nroff  documentation instead; for instance, you can use the ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting and fill‐
              ing.

       -p string, --preprocessor=string
              Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff/groff.  Not all installations will have a full set of preprocessors.   Some
              of  the  preprocessors  and  the  letters used to designate them are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer (r).  This option
              overrides the $MANROFFSEQ environment variable.  zsoelim is always run as the very first preprocessor.

       -t, --troff
              Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This option is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to be suitable for a device other than the default.  It implies -t.  Examples
              (provided with Groff-1.17) include dvi, latin1, ps, utf8, X75 and X100.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This  option  will  cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web browser.  The choice of browser is determined by
              the optional browser argument if one is provided, by the $BROWSER environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually
              lynx).  This option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.

       -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]
              This option displays the output of groff in a graphical window using the gxditview program.  The dpi (dots per inch) may be 75, 75-12, 100, or
              100-12, defaulting to 75; the -12 variants use a 12-point base font.  This option implies -T with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device re‐
              spectively.

       -Z, --ditroff
              groff  will run troff and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for the chosen device.  If groff -mandoc is groff,
              this option is passed to groff and will suppress the use of a post-processor.  It implies -t.

   Getting help
       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

       MANROFFOPT
              Every time man invokes the formatter (nroff, troff, or groff), it adds the contents of $MANROFFOPT to the formatter's command line.

       MANROFFSEQ
              If $MANROFFSEQ is set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors to pass each manual page  through.   The  default  preprocessor
              list is system dependent.

       MANSECT
              If  $MANSECT  is  set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and it is used to determine which manual sections to search and in what
              order.  The default is "1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7", unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              If $MANPAGER or $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its value is used as the name of the program used to display the manual page.
              By default, pager is used, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.

              The  value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).
              It may not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an ar‐
              gument or on standard input.

       MANLESS
              If  $MANLESS  is set, its value will be used as the default prompt string for the less pager, as if it had been passed using the -r option (so
              any occurrences of the text $MAN_PN will be expanded in the same way).  For example, if you want to set the prompt string  unconditionally  to
              “my prompt string”, set $MANLESS to ‘-Psmy prompt string’.  Using the -r option overrides this environment variable.

       BROWSER
              If  $BROWSER  is  set,  its  value  is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a web browser for man
              --html.  In each command, %s is replaced by a filename containing the HTML output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and
              %c is replaced by a colon (:).

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m option.

       MANOPT If  $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to be in a similar format.  As all of the other man specific
              environment variables can be expressed as command line options, and are thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is expected that they
              will become obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that should be interpreted as part of an option's argument must be escaped.

       MANWIDTH
              If  $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be formatted.  If it is not set, manual pages will be
              formatted with a line length appropriate to the current terminal (using the value of $COLUMNS, and ioctl(2) if available, or falling  back  to
              80  characters if neither is available).  Cat pages will only be saved when the default formatting can be used, that is when the terminal line
              length is between 66 and 80 characters.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              Normally, when output is not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are discarded to make it easier
              to read the result without special tools.  However, if $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING is set to any non-empty value, these formatting characters are re‐
              tained.  This may be useful for wrappers around man that can interpret formatting characters.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              Normally, when output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a pager), any error output from the command used to produce  formatted  ver‐
              sions of manual pages is discarded to avoid interfering with the pager's display.  Programs such as groff often produce relatively minor error
              messages about typographical problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally confusing when displayed along with the manual
              page.   However,  some users want to see them anyway, so, if $MAN_KEEP_STDERR is set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed as
              usual.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              Depending on system and implementation, either or both of $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated for the  current  message  locale.   man
              will display its messages in that locale (if available).  See setlocale(3) for precise details.

FILES
       /etc/manpath.config
              man-db configuration file.

       /usr/share/man

NAME
       cp - copy files and directories

SYNOPSIS
       cp [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
       cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
       cp [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...

DESCRIPTION
       Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --archive
              same as -dR --preserve=all

       --attributes-only
              don't copy the file data, just the attributes

       --backup[=CONTROL]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       --copy-contents
              copy contents of special files when recursive

       -d     same as --no-dereference --preserve=links

       -f, --force
              if an existing destination file cannot be opened, remove it and try again (this option is ignored when the -n option is also used)

       -i, --interactive
              prompt before overwrite (overrides a previous -n option)

       -H     follow command-line symbolic links in SOURCE

       -l, --link
              hard link files instead of copying

       -L, --dereference
              always follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -n, --no-clobber
              do not overwrite an existing file (overrides a previous -i option)

       -P, --no-dereference
              never follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -p     same as --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps

       --preserve[=ATTR_LIST]
              preserve the specified attributes (default: mode,ownership,timestamps), if possible additional attributes: context, links, xattr, all

       --no-preserve=ATTR_LIST
              don't preserve the specified attributes

       --parents
              use full source file name under DIRECTORY

       -R, -r, --recursive
              copy directories recursively

       --reflink[=WHEN]
              control clone/CoW copies. See below

       --remove-destination
              remove each existing destination file before attempting to open it (contrast with --force)

       --sparse=WHEN
              control creation of sparse files. See below

       --strip-trailing-slashes
              remove any trailing slashes from each SOURCE argument

       -s, --symbolic-link
              make symbolic links instead of copying

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
              override the usual backup suffix

       -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              copy all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY

       -T, --no-target-directory
              treat DEST as a normal file

       -u, --update
              copy only when the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       -x, --one-file-system
              stay on this file system

       -Z     set SELinux security context of destination file to default type

       --context[=CTX]
              like -Z, or if CTX is specified then set the SELinux or SMACK security context to CTX

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       By  default,  sparse SOURCE files are detected by a crude heuristic and the corresponding DEST file is made sparse as well.  That is the behavior se‐
       lected by --sparse=auto.  Specify --sparse=always to create a sparse DEST file whenever the SOURCE file contains  a  long  enough  sequence  of  zero
       bytes.  Use --sparse=never to inhibit creation of sparse files.

       When  --reflink[=always]  is specified, perform a lightweight copy, where the data blocks are copied only when modified.  If this is not possible the
       copy fails, or if --reflink=auto is specified, fall back to a standard copy.  Use --reflink=never to ensure a standard copy is performed.

       The backup suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may be selected via the  --backup  option  or
       through the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

       As  a  special  case,  cp makes a backup of SOURCE when the force and backup options are given and SOURCE and DEST are the same name for an existing,
       regular file.
