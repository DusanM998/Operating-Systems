NAME
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).  Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --all
              do not ignore entries starting with .

       -A, --almost-all
              do not list implied . and ..

       --author
              with -l, print the author of each file

       -b, --escape
              print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters

       --block-size=SIZE
              with -l, scale sizes by SIZE when printing them; e.g., '--block-size=M'; see SIZE format below

       -B, --ignore-backups
              do not list implied entries ending with ~

       -c     with  -lt:  sort by, and show, ctime (time of last modification of file status information); with -l: show ctime and sort by name; otherwise: sort by
              ctime, newest first

       -C     list entries by columns

       --color[=WHEN]
              colorize the output; WHEN can be 'always' (default if omitted), 'auto', or 'never'; more info below

       -d, --directory
              list directories themselves, not their contents

       -D, --dired
              generate output designed for Emacs' dired mode

       -f     do not sort, enable -aU, disable -ls --color

       -F, --classify
              append indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries

       --file-type
              likewise, except do not append '*'

       --group-directories-first
              group directories before files;

              can be augmented with a --sort option, but any use of --sort=none (-U) disables grouping

       -G, --no-group
              in a long listing, don't print group names

       -h, --human-readable
              with -l and -s, print sizes like 1K 234M 2G etc.

       --si   likewise, but use powers of 1000 not 1024

       -k, --kibibytes
              default to 1024-byte blocks for disk usage; used only with -s and per directory totals

       -l     use a long listing format

       -L, --dereference
              when showing file information for a symbolic link, show information for the file the link references rather than for the link itself

       -m     fill width with a comma separated list of entries

       -n, --numeric-uid-gid

              append / indicator to directories

       -q, --hide-control-chars
              print ? instead of nongraphic characters

       --show-control-chars
              show nongraphic characters as-is (the default, unless program is 'ls' and output is a terminal)

       -Q, --quote-name
              enclose entry names in double quotes

       --quoting-style=WORD
              use quoting style WORD for entry names: literal, locale, shell, shell-always, shell-escape, shell-escape-always, c, escape  (overrides  QUOTING_STYLE
              environment variable)

       -r, --reverse
              reverse order while sorting

       -R, --recursive
              list subdirectories recursively

       -s, --size
              print the allocated size of each file, in blocks

       -S     sort by file size, largest first

       --sort=WORD
              sort by WORD instead of name: none (-U), size (-S), time (-t), version (-v), extension (-X)

       --time=WORD
              with  -l,  show time as WORD instead of default modification time: atime or access or use (-u); ctime or status (-c); also use specified time as sort
              key if --sort=time (newest first)

       --time-style=TIME_STYLE
              time/date format with -l; see TIME_STYLE below

       -t     sort by modification time, newest first

       -T, --tabsize=COLS
              assume tab stops at each COLS instead of 8

       -u     with -lt: sort by, and show, access time; with -l: show access time and sort by name; otherwise: sort by access time, newest first

       -U     do not sort; list entries in directory order

       -v     natural sort of (version) numbers within text

       -w, --width=COLS
              set output width to COLS.  0 means no limit

       -x     list entries by lines instead of by columns

       -X     sort alphabetically by entry extension

       -Z, --context
              print any security context of each file

       -1     list one file per line.  Avoid '\n' with -q or -b

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).  Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,... (powers of 1000).

       The TIME_STYLE argument can be full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT.  FORMAT is interpreted like in date(1).  If FORMAT  is  FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2,
       then  FORMAT1  applies to non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files.  TIME_STYLE prefixed with 'posix-' takes effect only outside the POSIX locale.  Also
       the TIME_STYLE environment variable sets the default style to use.

       Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and with --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when standard output
       is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.

   Exit status:
       0      if OK,

       1      if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),

       2      if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

NAME
       man - an interface to the system reference manuals

SYNOPSIS
       man [man options] [[section] page ...] ...
       man -k [apropos options] regexp ...
       man -K [man options] [section] term ...
       man -f [whatis options] page ...
       man -l [man options] file ...
       man -w|-W [man options] page ...

DESCRIPTION
       man  is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associated with
       each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of the manual.  The  default  ac‐
       tion  is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found, even if page exists
       in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE,  ERRORS,  ENVIRONMENT,  FILES,  VERSIONS,
       CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact  rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render italics when running in a terminal, and will
       typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable to illustrate several exclusive
       invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

       man man.7
           Display the manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is an alternative spelling of "man 7 man".)

       man 'man(7)'
           Display  the  manual  page  for macro package man from section 7.  (This is another alternative spelling of "man 7 man".  It may be more convenient when
           copying and pasting cross-references to manual pages.  Note that the parentheses must normally be quoted to protect them from the shell.)

       man -a intro
           Display, in succession, all of the available intro manual pages contained within the manual.  It is possible to quit between successive displays or skip
           any of them.

       man -t bash | lpr -Pps
           Format  the  manual  page  for bash into the default troff or groff format and pipe it to the printer named ps.  The default output for groff is usually
           PostScript.  man --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.

       man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a device independent (dvi) file.  The redirection is necessary  as
           the  -T  flag  causes  output  to be directed to stdout with no pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi or further processed into
           PostScript using a program such as dvips.

       man -k printf
           Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.  Print out any matches.  Equivalent to apropos printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short descriptions of any found.  Equivalent to whatis smail.

OVERVIEW
       Many options are available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes can be made to the search path, section order, out‐
       put processor, and other behaviours and operations detailed below.

       If  set,  various  environment  variables are interrogated to determine the operation of man.  It is possible to set the "catch-all" variable $MANOPT to any
       string in command line format, with the exception that any spaces used as part of an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).  man  will
       parse  $MANOPT prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options requiring an argument will be overridden by the same options found on the command line.
       To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be specified as the initial command line option.  This will allow man to "forget" about the options spec‐
       ified in $MANOPT, although they must still have been valid.

       Manual  pages  are  normally  stored in nroff(1) format under a directory such as /usr/share/man.  In some installations, there may also be preformatted cat
       pages to improve performance.  See manpath(5) for details of where these files are stored.

       This package supports manual pages in multiple languages, controlled by your locale.  If your system did not set this up for you automatically, then you may
       need to set $LC_MESSAGES, $LANG, or another system-dependent environment variable to indicate your preferred locale, usually specified in the POSIX format:

       <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your locale, it will be displayed in lieu of the standard (usually American English) page.

       If you find that the translations supplied with this package are not available in your native language and you would like to supply them, please contact the
       maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.

       Individual manual pages are normally written and maintained by the maintainers of the program, function, or other topic that they document, and are not  in‐
       cluded with this package.  If you find that a manual page is missing or inadequate, please report that to the maintainers of the package in question.

       For information regarding other features and extensions available with this manual pager, please read the documents supplied with the package.

DEFAULTS
       The order of sections to search may be overridden by the environment variable $MANSECT or by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.  By default it is
       as follows:

              1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7

       The formatted manual page is displayed using a pager.  This can be specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default (see option -P for de‐
       tails).

       The  filters  are  deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line option -p or the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is interrogated.  If -p was
       not used and the environment variable was not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain a valid  preprocessor
       string, the first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A  formatting  pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable pro‐
       gram mandb_nfmt (or mandb_tfmt with -t) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets  passed  the  manual  source  file,  the  preprocessor
       string, and optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non-argument  options  that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both, are not harmful.  For options that require an argument, each du‐
       plication will override the previous argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
              This option is normally issued as the very first option and resets man's behaviour to its default.  Its use is to reset those options that  may  have
              been set in $MANOPT.  Any options that follow -D will have their usual effect.

       --warnings[=warnings]
              Enable  warnings  from  groff.   This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of manual pages.  warnings is a comma-separated list of
              warning names; if it is not supplied, the default is "mac".  See the “Warnings” node in info groff for a list of available warning names.

   Main modes of operation
       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent to whatis.  Display a short description from the manual page, if available.  See whatis(1) for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1) for details.

       -K, --global-apropos
              Search for text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time; if you can, you should specify a section to  re‐
              duce the number of pages that need to be searched.  Search terms may be simple strings (the default), or regular expressions if the --regex option is
              used.

              Note that this searches the sources of the manual pages, not the rendered text, and so may include false positives due to  things  like  comments  in
              source files.  Searching the rendered text would be much slower.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate "local" mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching through the system's manual collection.  Each manual page argument
              will be interpreted as an nroff source file in the correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the arguments, input will be
              taken  from stdin.  When this option is not used, and man fails to find the page required, before displaying the error message, it attempts to act as
              if this option was supplied, using the name as a filename and looking for an exact match.

       -w, --where, --path, --location
              Don't actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the source nroff file that would be formatted.  If the -a option is  also  used,
              then print the locations of all source files that match the search criteria.

       -W, --where-cat, --location-cat
              Don't  actually  display  the  manual page, but do print the location of the preformatted cat file that would be displayed.  If the -a option is also
              used, then print the locations of all preformatted cat files that match the search criteria.

              If -w and -W are both used, then print both source file and cat file separated by a space.  If all of -w, -W, and -a are used, then do this for  each
              possible match.

       -c, --catman
              This option is not for general use and should only be used by the catman program.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead  of  formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the specified encoding.  If you already know the encoding of
              the source file, you can also use manconv(1) directly.  However, this option allows you to convert several manual pages to a single encoding  without
              having to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they were already installed in a structure similar to a manual page hierarchy.

              Consider  using man-recode(1) instead for converting multiple manual pages, since it has an interface designed for bulk conversion and so can be much
              faster.

   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              man will normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which interrogates various environment  variables,  possibly
              including  $LC_MESSAGES  and  $LANG.   To temporarily override the determined value, use this option to supply a locale string directly to man.  Note
              that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such as the help message will always be displayed in  the  initially
              determined locale.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If this system has access to other operating system's manual pages, they can be accessed using this option.  To search for a manual page from NewOS's
              manual page collection, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include a search of the  native  operating  system's  manual
              pages, include the system name man in the argument string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify  an alternate manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath derived code to determine the path to search.  This option overrides the $MANPATH
              environment variable and causes option -m to be ignored.

              A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into sections as described in the man-db manual (under "The man‐
              ual page system").  To view manual pages outside such hierarchies, see the -l option.

       -S list, -s list, --sections=list
              The  given  list  is  a colon- or comma-separated list of sections, used to determine which manual sections to search and in what order.  This option
              overrides the $MANSECT environment variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility with System V.)

       -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension
              Some systems incorporate large packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the Tcl package, into the main manual page hierarchy.   To  get
              around  the  problem of having two manual pages with the same name such as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to section l.  As this is
              unfortunate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and to assign a specific "extension" to them, in this case, exit(3tcl).  Un‐
              der  normal  operation,  man will display exit(3) in preference to exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and to avoid having to know which section
              the page you require resides in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string indicating which package the page must belong to.   Using  the
              above example, supplying the option -e tcl to man will restrict the search to pages having an extension of *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       --regex
              Show  all  pages  with  any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument as a regular expression, as with apropos(1).
              Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a regular expression, this option implies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument using shell-style wildcards, as with  apropos(1)
              --wildcard.   The page argument must match the entire name or description, or match on word boundaries in the description.  Since there is usually no
              reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a wildcard, this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If the --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names, not page descriptions, as with whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By default, man will exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.  Using this option forces man to display all the manual pages with
              names that match the search criteria.

       -u, --update
              This option causes man to update its database caches of installed manual pages.  This is only needed in rare situations, and it is normally better to
              run mandb(8) instead.

       --no-subpages
              By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the command line as equivalent to a single manual page  name  containing  a
              hyphen  or an underscore.  This supports the common pattern of programs that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to provide manual pages
              for each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to invoke the subcommands themselves.  For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify which output pager to use.  By default, man uses pager, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.   This  option  over‐
              rides the $MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is not used in conjunction with -f or -k.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).  It may
              not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an  argument  or  on
              standard input.

       -r prompt, --prompt=prompt
              If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to set its prompt and some sensible options.  The default prompt looks like

               Manual page name(sec) line x

              where  name  denotes  the  manual page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x the current line number.  This is achieved by using the
              $LESS environment variable.

              Supplying -r with a string will override this default.  The string may contain the text $MAN_PN which will be expanded to the  name  of  the  current
              manual page and its section name surrounded by "(" and ")".  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              \ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:
              byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..
              (press h for help or q to quit)

              It is broken into three lines here for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the less(1) manual page.  The prompt string is first evalu‐
              ated by the shell.  All double quotes, back-quotes and backslashes in the prompt must be escaped by a preceding backslash.  The prompt string may end
              in an escaped $ which may be followed by further options for less.  By default man sets the -ix8 options.

              The $MANLESS environment variable described below may be used to set a default prompt string if none is supplied on the command line.

       -7, --ascii
              When viewing a pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may not display correctly when using the latin1(7)
              device description with GNU nroff.  This option allows pure ascii manual pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1 device.  It will  not  trans‐
              late  any  latin1 text.  The following table shows the translations performed: some parts of it may only be displayed properly when using GNU nroff's
              latin1(7) device.

              Description           Octal   latin1   ascii
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────
              continuation hyphen    255      ‐        -
              bullet (middle dot)    267      •        o
              acute accent           264      ´        '
              multiplication sign    327      ×        x

              If the latin1 column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters and this option is not necessary.  If the latin1 and ascii
              columns  are  identical,  you  are  reading  this page using this option or man did not format this page using the latin1 device description.  If the
              latin1 column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual pages with this option.

              This option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for nroff other than GNU's.

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward compatibility, encoding may be an nroff device such as ascii,  latin1,
              or utf8 as well as a true character encoding such as UTF-8.

       --no-hyphenation, --nh
              Normally,  nroff  will  automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not contain hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to lay out
              words on a line without excessive spacing.  This option disables automatic hyphenation, so words will only be hyphenated if they already contain  hy‐
              phens.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at an inappropriate point, do not use this option, but con‐
              sult the nroff documentation instead; for instance, you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at that point, or  put  "\%"
              at the start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.

       --no-justification, --nj
              Normally, nroff will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full justification, leaving justified only to the left margin,
              sometimes called "ragged-right" text.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain paragraphs, do not use this option, but consult  the  nroff
              documentation instead; for instance, you can use the ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting and filling.

       -p string, --preprocessor=string
              Specify  the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff/groff.  Not all installations will have a full set of preprocessors.  Some of the
              preprocessors and the letters used to designate them are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer  (r).   This  option  overrides  the
              $MANROFFSEQ environment variable.  zsoelim is always run as the very first preprocessor.

       -t, --troff
              Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This  option is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to be suitable for a device other than the default.  It implies -t.  Examples (pro‐
              vided with Groff-1.17) include dvi, latin1, ps, utf8, X75 and X100.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This option will cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web browser.  The choice of browser is determined by  the  op‐
              tional browser argument if one is provided, by the $BROWSER environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually lynx).  This
              option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.

       -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]
              This option displays the output of groff in a graphical window using the gxditview program.  The dpi (dots per  inch)  may  be  75,  75-12,  100,  or
              100-12,  defaulting  to  75; the -12 variants use a 12-point base font.  This option implies -T with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device respec‐
              tively.

       -Z, --ditroff
              groff will run troff and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for the chosen device.  If groff -mandoc  is  groff,  this
              option is passed to groff and will suppress the use of a post-processor.  It implies -t.

   Getting help
       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

       MANROFFOPT
              Every time man invokes the formatter (nroff, troff, or groff), it adds the contents of $MANROFFOPT to the formatter's command line.

       MANROFFSEQ
              If  $MANROFFSEQ  is  set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors to pass each manual page through.  The default preprocessor list is
              system dependent.

       MANSECT
              If $MANSECT is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and it is used to determine which manual sections to search and  in  what  order.
              The default is "1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7", unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              If  $MANPAGER  or  $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its value is used as the name of the program used to display the manual page.  By
              default, pager is used, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).  It may
              not  use  pipes  to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an argument or on
              standard input.

       MANLESS
              If $MANLESS is set, its value will be used as the default prompt string for the less pager, as if it had been passed using the -r option (so any  oc‐
              currences  of  the  text  $MAN_PN will be expanded in the same way).  For example, if you want to set the prompt string unconditionally to “my prompt
              string”, set $MANLESS to ‘-Psmy prompt string’.  Using the -r option overrides this environment variable.

       BROWSER
              If $BROWSER is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a web browser for man --html.   In
              each  command, %s is replaced by a filename containing the HTML output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and %c is replaced by
              a colon (:).

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m option.

       MANOPT If $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to be in a similar format.  As all of the other man  specific  envi‐
              ronment  variables  can be expressed as command line options, and are thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is expected that they will be‐
              come obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that should be interpreted as part of an option's argument must be escaped.

       MANWIDTH
              If $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be formatted.  If it is not set, manual pages will be format‐
              ted  with a line length appropriate to the current terminal (using the value of $COLUMNS, and ioctl(2) if available, or falling back to 80 characters
              if neither is available).  Cat pages will only be saved when the default formatting can be used, that is when the terminal line length is between  66
              and 80 characters.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              Normally,  when  output  is  not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are discarded to make it easier to
              read the result without special tools.  However, if $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING is set to any non-empty value, these  formatting  characters  are  retained.
              This may be useful for wrappers around man that can interpret formatting characters.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              Normally,  when  output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a pager), any error output from the command used to produce formatted versions of
              manual pages is discarded to avoid interfering with the pager's display.  Programs such as groff often produce relatively minor error messages  about
              typographical  problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally confusing when displayed along with the manual page.  However, some
              users want to see them anyway, so, if $MAN_KEEP_STDERR is set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed as usual.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              Depending on system and implementation, either or both of $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated for the current message locale.  man will  dis‐
              play its messages in that locale (if available).  See setlocale(3) for precise details.

       /etc/manpath.config
              man-db configuration file.

NAME
       man - an interface to the system reference manuals

SYNOPSIS
       man [man options] [[section] page ...] ...
       man -k [apropos options] regexp ...
       man -K [man options] [section] term ...
       man -f [whatis options] page ...
       man -l [man options] file ...
       man -w|-W [man options] page ...

DESCRIPTION
       man  is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associated with
       each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of the manual.  The  default  ac‐
       tion  is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found, even if page exists
       in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE,  ERRORS,  ENVIRONMENT,  FILES,  VERSIONS,
       CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact  rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render italics when running in a terminal, and will
       typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable to illustrate several exclusive
       invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

       man man.7
           Display the manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is an alternative spelling of "man 7 man".)

       man 'man(7)'
           Display  the  manual  page  for macro package man from section 7.  (This is another alternative spelling of "man 7 man".  It may be more convenient when
           copying and pasting cross-references to manual pages.  Note that the parentheses must normally be quoted to protect them from the shell.)

       man -a intro
           Display, in succession, all of the available intro manual pages contained within the manual.  It is possible to quit between successive displays or skip
           any of them.

       man -t bash | lpr -Pps
           Format  the  manual  page  for bash into the default troff or groff format and pipe it to the printer named ps.  The default output for groff is usually
           PostScript.  man --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.

       man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a device independent (dvi) file.  The redirection is necessary  as
           the  -T  flag  causes  output  to be directed to stdout with no pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi or further processed into
           PostScript using a program such as dvips.

       man -k printf
           Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.  Print out any matches.  Equivalent to apropos printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short descriptions of any found.  Equivalent to whatis smail.

OVERVIEW
       Many options are available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes can be made to the search path, section order, out‐
       put processor, and other behaviours and operations detailed below.

       If  set,  various  environment  variables are interrogated to determine the operation of man.  It is possible to set the "catch-all" variable $MANOPT to any
       string in command line format, with the exception that any spaces used as part of an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).  man  will
       parse  $MANOPT prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options requiring an argument will be overridden by the same options found on the command line.
       To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be specified as the initial command line option.  This will allow man to "forget" about the options spec‐
       ified in $MANOPT, although they must still have been valid.

       Manual  pages  are  normally  stored in nroff(1) format under a directory such as /usr/share/man.  In some installations, there may also be preformatted cat
       pages to improve performance.  See manpath(5) for details of where these files are stored.

       This package supports manual pages in multiple languages, controlled by your locale.  If your system did not set this up for you automatically, then you may
       need to set $LC_MESSAGES, $LANG, or another system-dependent environment variable to indicate your preferred locale, usually specified in the POSIX format:

       <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your locale, it will be displayed in lieu of the standard (usually American English) page.

       If you find that the translations supplied with this package are not available in your native language and you would like to supply them, please contact the
       maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.

       Individual manual pages are normally written and maintained by the maintainers of the program, function, or other topic that they document, and are not  in‐
       cluded with this package.  If you find that a manual page is missing or inadequate, please report that to the maintainers of the package in question.

       For information regarding other features and extensions available with this manual pager, please read the documents supplied with the package.

DEFAULTS
       The order of sections to search may be overridden by the environment variable $MANSECT or by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.  By default it is
       as follows:

              1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7

       The formatted manual page is displayed using a pager.  This can be specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default (see option -P for de‐
       tails).

       The  filters  are  deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line option -p or the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is interrogated.  If -p was
       not used and the environment variable was not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain a valid  preprocessor
       string, the first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A  formatting  pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable pro‐
       gram mandb_nfmt (or mandb_tfmt with -t) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets  passed  the  manual  source  file,  the  preprocessor
       string, and optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non-argument  options  that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both, are not harmful.  For options that require an argument, each du‐
       plication will override the previous argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
              This option is normally issued as the very first option and resets man's behaviour to its default.  Its use is to reset those options that  may  have
              been set in $MANOPT.  Any options that follow -D will have their usual effect.

       --warnings[=warnings]
              Enable  warnings  from  groff.   This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of manual pages.  warnings is a comma-separated list of
              warning names; if it is not supplied, the default is "mac".  See the “Warnings” node in info groff for a list of available warning names.

   Main modes of operation
       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent to whatis.  Display a short description from the manual page, if available.  See whatis(1) for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1) for details.

       -K, --global-apropos
              Search for text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time; if you can, you should specify a section to  re‐
              duce the number of pages that need to be searched.  Search terms may be simple strings (the default), or regular expressions if the --regex option is
              used.

              Note that this searches the sources of the manual pages, not the rendered text, and so may include false positives due to  things  like  comments  in
              source files.  Searching the rendered text would be much slower.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate "local" mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching through the system's manual collection.  Each manual page argument
              will be interpreted as an nroff source file in the correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the arguments, input will be
              taken  from stdin.  When this option is not used, and man fails to find the page required, before displaying the error message, it attempts to act as
              if this option was supplied, using the name as a filename and looking for an exact match.

       -w, --where, --path, --location
              Don't actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the source nroff file that would be formatted.  If the -a option is  also  used,
              then print the locations of all source files that match the search criteria.

       -W, --where-cat, --location-cat
              Don't  actually  display  the  manual page, but do print the location of the preformatted cat file that would be displayed.  If the -a option is also
              used, then print the locations of all preformatted cat files that match the search criteria.

              If -w and -W are both used, then print both source file and cat file separated by a space.  If all of -w, -W, and -a are used, then do this for  each
              possible match.

       -c, --catman
              This option is not for general use and should only be used by the catman program.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead  of  formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the specified encoding.  If you already know the encoding of
              the source file, you can also use manconv(1) directly.  However, this option allows you to convert several manual pages to a single encoding  without
              having to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they were already installed in a structure similar to a manual page hierarchy.

              Consider  using man-recode(1) instead for converting multiple manual pages, since it has an interface designed for bulk conversion and so can be much
              faster.

   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              man will normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which interrogates various environment  variables,  possibly
              including  $LC_MESSAGES  and  $LANG.   To temporarily override the determined value, use this option to supply a locale string directly to man.  Note
              that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such as the help message will always be displayed in  the  initially
              determined locale.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If this system has access to other operating system's manual pages, they can be accessed using this option.  To search for a manual page from NewOS's
              manual page collection, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include a search of the  native  operating  system's  manual
              pages, include the system name man in the argument string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify  an alternate manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath derived code to determine the path to search.  This option overrides the $MANPATH
              environment variable and causes option -m to be ignored.

              A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into sections as described in the man-db manual (under "The man‐
              ual page system").  To view manual pages outside such hierarchies, see the -l option.

       -S list, -s list, --sections=list
              The  given  list  is  a colon- or comma-separated list of sections, used to determine which manual sections to search and in what order.  This option
              overrides the $MANSECT environment variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility with System V.)

       -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension
              Some systems incorporate large packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the Tcl package, into the main manual page hierarchy.   To  get
              around  the  problem of having two manual pages with the same name such as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to section l.  As this is
              unfortunate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and to assign a specific "extension" to them, in this case, exit(3tcl).  Un‐
              der  normal  operation,  man will display exit(3) in preference to exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and to avoid having to know which section
              the page you require resides in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string indicating which package the page must belong to.   Using  the
              above example, supplying the option -e tcl to man will restrict the search to pages having an extension of *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       --regex
              Show  all  pages  with  any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument as a regular expression, as with apropos(1).
              Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a regular expression, this option implies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument using shell-style wildcards, as with  apropos(1)
              --wildcard.   The page argument must match the entire name or description, or match on word boundaries in the description.  Since there is usually no
              reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a wildcard, this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If the --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names, not page descriptions, as with whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By default, man will exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.  Using this option forces man to display all the manual pages with
              names that match the search criteria.

       -u, --update
              This option causes man to update its database caches of installed manual pages.  This is only needed in rare situations, and it is normally better to
              run mandb(8) instead.

       --no-subpages
              By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the command line as equivalent to a single manual page  name  containing  a
              hyphen  or an underscore.  This supports the common pattern of programs that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to provide manual pages
              for each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to invoke the subcommands themselves.  For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify which output pager to use.  By default, man uses pager, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.   This  option  over‐
              rides the $MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is not used in conjunction with -f or -k.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).  It may
              not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an  argument  or  on
              standard input.

       -r prompt, --prompt=prompt
              If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to set its prompt and some sensible options.  The default prompt looks like

               Manual page name(sec) line x

              where  name  denotes  the  manual page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x the current line number.  This is achieved by using the
              $LESS environment variable.

              Supplying -r with a string will override this default.  The string may contain the text $MAN_PN which will be expanded to the  name  of  the  current
              manual page and its section name surrounded by "(" and ")".  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              \ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:
              byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..
              (press h for help or q to quit)

              It is broken into three lines here for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the less(1) manual page.  The prompt string is first evalu‐
              ated by the shell.  All double quotes, back-quotes and backslashes in the prompt must be escaped by a preceding backslash.  The prompt string may end
              in an escaped $ which may be followed by further options for less.  By default man sets the -ix8 options.

              The $MANLESS environment variable described below may be used to set a default prompt string if none is supplied on the command line.

       -7, --ascii
              When viewing a pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may not display correctly when using the latin1(7)
              device description with GNU nroff.  This option allows pure ascii manual pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1 device.  It will  not  trans‐
              late  any  latin1 text.  The following table shows the translations performed: some parts of it may only be displayed properly when using GNU nroff's
              latin1(7) device.

              Description           Octal   latin1   ascii
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────
              continuation hyphen    255      ‐        -
              bullet (middle dot)    267      •        o
              acute accent           264      ´        '
              multiplication sign    327      ×        x

              If the latin1 column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters and this option is not necessary.  If the latin1 and ascii
              columns  are  identical,  you  are  reading  this page using this option or man did not format this page using the latin1 device description.  If the
              latin1 column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual pages with this option.

              This option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for nroff other than GNU's.

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward compatibility, encoding may be an nroff device such as ascii,  latin1,
              or utf8 as well as a true character encoding such as UTF-8.

       --no-hyphenation, --nh
              Normally,  nroff  will  automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not contain hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to lay out
              words on a line without excessive spacing.  This option disables automatic hyphenation, so words will only be hyphenated if they already contain  hy‐
              phens.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at an inappropriate point, do not use this option, but con‐
              sult the nroff documentation instead; for instance, you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at that point, or  put  "\%"
              at the start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.

       --no-justification, --nj
              Normally, nroff will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full justification, leaving justified only to the left margin,
              sometimes called "ragged-right" text.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain paragraphs, do not use this option, but consult  the  nroff
              documentation instead; for instance, you can use the ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting and filling.

       -p string, --preprocessor=string
              Specify  the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff/groff.  Not all installations will have a full set of preprocessors.  Some of the
              preprocessors and the letters used to designate them are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer  (r).   This  option  overrides  the
              $MANROFFSEQ environment variable.  zsoelim is always run as the very first preprocessor.

       -t, --troff
              Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This  option is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to be suitable for a device other than the default.  It implies -t.  Examples (pro‐
              vided with Groff-1.17) include dvi, latin1, ps, utf8, X75 and X100.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This option will cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web browser.  The choice of browser is determined by  the  op‐
              tional browser argument if one is provided, by the $BROWSER environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually lynx).  This
              option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.

       -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]
              This option displays the output of groff in a graphical window using the gxditview program.  The dpi (dots per  inch)  may  be  75,  75-12,  100,  or
              100-12,  defaulting  to  75; the -12 variants use a 12-point base font.  This option implies -T with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device respec‐
              tively.

       -Z, --ditroff
              groff will run troff and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for the chosen device.  If groff -mandoc  is  groff,  this
              option is passed to groff and will suppress the use of a post-processor.  It implies -t.

   Getting help
       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.

       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

       MANROFFOPT
              Every time man invokes the formatter (nroff, troff, or groff), it adds the contents of $MANROFFOPT to the formatter's command line.

       MANROFFSEQ
              If  $MANROFFSEQ  is  set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors to pass each manual page through.  The default preprocessor list is
              system dependent.

       MANSECT
              If $MANSECT is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and it is used to determine which manual sections to search and  in  what  order.
              The default is "1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7", unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              If  $MANPAGER  or  $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its value is used as the name of the program used to display the manual page.  By
              default, pager is used, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).  It may
              not  use  pipes  to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an argument or on
              standard input.

       MANLESS
              If $MANLESS is set, its value will be used as the default prompt string for the less pager, as if it had been passed using the -r option (so any  oc‐
              currences  of  the  text  $MAN_PN will be expanded in the same way).  For example, if you want to set the prompt string unconditionally to “my prompt
              string”, set $MANLESS to ‘-Psmy prompt string’.  Using the -r option overrides this environment variable.

       BROWSER
              If $BROWSER is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a web browser for man --html.   In
              each  command, %s is replaced by a filename containing the HTML output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and %c is replaced by
              a colon (:).

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m option.

       MANOPT If $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to be in a similar format.  As all of the other man  specific  envi‐
              ronment  variables  can be expressed as command line options, and are thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is expected that they will be‐
              come obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that should be interpreted as part of an option's argument must be escaped.

       MANWIDTH
              If $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be formatted.  If it is not set, manual pages will be format‐
              ted  with a line length appropriate to the current terminal (using the value of $COLUMNS, and ioctl(2) if available, or falling back to 80 characters
              if neither is available).  Cat pages will only be saved when the default formatting can be used, that is when the terminal line length is between  66
              and 80 characters.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              Normally,  when  output  is  not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are discarded to make it easier to
              read the result without special tools.  However, if $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING is set to any non-empty value, these  formatting  characters  are  retained.
              This may be useful for wrappers around man that can interpret formatting characters.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              Normally,  when  output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a pager), any error output from the command used to produce formatted versions of
              manual pages is discarded to avoid interfering with the pager's display.  Programs such as groff often produce relatively minor error messages  about
              typographical  problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally confusing when displayed along with the manual page.  However, some
              users want to see them anyway, so, if $MAN_KEEP_STDERR is set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed as usual.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              Depending on system and implementation, either or both of $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated for the current message locale.  man will  dis‐
              play its messages in that locale (if available).  See setlocale(3) for precise details.

NAME
       cp - copy files and directories

SYNOPSIS
       cp [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
       cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
       cp [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...

DESCRIPTION
       Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --archive
              same as -dR --preserve=all

       --attributes-only
              don't copy the file data, just the attributes

       --backup[=CONTROL]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       --copy-contents
              copy contents of special files when recursive

       -d     same as --no-dereference --preserve=links

       -f, --force
              if an existing destination file cannot be opened, remove it and try again (this option is ignored when the -n option is also used)

       -i, --interactive
              prompt before overwrite (overrides a previous -n option)

       -H     follow command-line symbolic links in SOURCE

       -l, --link
              hard link files instead of copying

       -L, --dereference
              always follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -n, --no-clobber
              do not overwrite an existing file (overrides a previous -i option)

       -P, --no-dereference
              never follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -p     same as --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps

       --preserve[=ATTR_LIST]
              preserve the specified attributes (default: mode,ownership,timestamps), if possible additional attributes: context, links, xattr, all

       --no-preserve=ATTR_LIST
              don't preserve the specified attributes

       --parents
              use full source file name under DIRECTORY

       -R, -r, --recursive
              copy directories recursively

       --reflink[=WHEN]
              control clone/CoW copies. See below

       --remove-destination
              remove each existing destination file before attempting to open it (contrast with --force)

       --sparse=WHEN
              control creation of sparse files. See below

       --strip-trailing-slashes
              remove any trailing slashes from each SOURCE argument

       -s, --symbolic-link
              make symbolic links instead of copying

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
              override the usual backup suffix

       -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              copy all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY

       -T, --no-target-directory
              treat DEST as a normal file

       -u, --update
              copy only when the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       -x, --one-file-system
              stay on this file system

       -Z     set SELinux security context of destination file to default type

       --context[=CTX]
              like -Z, or if CTX is specified then set the SELinux or SMACK security context to CTX

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       By  default, sparse SOURCE files are detected by a crude heuristic and the corresponding DEST file is made sparse as well.  That is the behavior selected by
       --sparse=auto.  Specify --sparse=always to create a sparse DEST file whenever the  SOURCE  file  contains  a  long  enough  sequence  of  zero  bytes.   Use
       --sparse=never to inhibit creation of sparse files.

       When  --reflink[=always]  is  specified,  perform a lightweight copy, where the data blocks are copied only when modified.  If this is not possible the copy
       fails, or if --reflink=auto is specified, fall back to a standard copy.  Use --reflink=never to ensure a standard copy is performed.

       The backup suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may be selected via the --backup option  or  through
       the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

       As  a  special  case, cp makes a backup of SOURCE when the force and backup options are given and SOURCE and DEST are the same name for an existing, regular
       file.

NAME
       man - an interface to the system reference manuals

SYNOPSIS
       man [man options] [[section] page ...] ...
       man -k [apropos options] regexp ...
       man -K [man options] [section] term ...
       man -f [whatis options] page ...
       man -l [man options] file ...
       man -w|-W [man options] page ...

DESCRIPTION
       man  is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associated with
       each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of the manual.  The  default  ac‐
       tion  is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found, even if page exists
       in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE,  ERRORS,  ENVIRONMENT,  FILES,  VERSIONS,
       CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact  rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render italics when running in a terminal, and will
       typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable to illustrate several exclusive
       invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

       man man.7
           Display the manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is an alternative spelling of "man 7 man".)

       man 'man(7)'
           Display  the  manual  page  for macro package man from section 7.  (This is another alternative spelling of "man 7 man".  It may be more convenient when
           copying and pasting cross-references to manual pages.  Note that the parentheses must normally be quoted to protect them from the shell.)

       man -a intro
           Display, in succession, all of the available intro manual pages contained within the manual.  It is possible to quit between successive displays or skip
           any of them.

       man -t bash | lpr -Pps
           Format  the  manual  page  for bash into the default troff or groff format and pipe it to the printer named ps.  The default output for groff is usually
           PostScript.  man --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.

       man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a device independent (dvi) file.  The redirection is necessary  as
           the  -T  flag  causes  output  to be directed to stdout with no pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi or further processed into
           PostScript using a program such as dvips.

       man -k printf
           Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.  Print out any matches.  Equivalent to apropos printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short descriptions of any found.  Equivalent to whatis smail.

OVERVIEW
       Many options are available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes can be made to the search path, section order, out‐
       put processor, and other behaviours and operations detailed below.

       If  set,  various  environment  variables are interrogated to determine the operation of man.  It is possible to set the "catch-all" variable $MANOPT to any
       string in command line format, with the exception that any spaces used as part of an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).  man  will
       parse  $MANOPT prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options requiring an argument will be overridden by the same options found on the command line.
       To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be specified as the initial command line option.  This will allow man to "forget" about the options spec‐
       ified in $MANOPT, although they must still have been valid.

       Manual  pages  are  normally  stored in nroff(1) format under a directory such as /usr/share/man.  In some installations, there may also be preformatted cat
       pages to improve performance.  See manpath(5) for details of where these files are stored.

       This package supports manual pages in multiple languages, controlled by your locale.  If your system did not set this up for you automatically, then you may
       need to set $LC_MESSAGES, $LANG, or another system-dependent environment variable to indicate your preferred locale, usually specified in the POSIX format:

       <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your locale, it will be displayed in lieu of the standard (usually American English) page.

       If you find that the translations supplied with this package are not available in your native language and you would like to supply them, please contact the
       maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.

       Individual manual pages are normally written and maintained by the maintainers of the program, function, or other topic that they document, and are not  in‐
       cluded with this package.  If you find that a manual page is missing or inadequate, please report that to the maintainers of the package in question.

       For information regarding other features and extensions available with this manual pager, please read the documents supplied with the package.

DEFAULTS
       The order of sections to search may be overridden by the environment variable $MANSECT or by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.  By default it is
       as follows:

              1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7

       The formatted manual page is displayed using a pager.  This can be specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default (see option -P for de‐
       tails).

       The  filters  are  deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line option -p or the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is interrogated.  If -p was
       not used and the environment variable was not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain a valid  preprocessor
       string, the first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A  formatting  pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable pro‐
       gram mandb_nfmt (or mandb_tfmt with -t) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets  passed  the  manual  source  file,  the  preprocessor
       string, and optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non-argument  options  that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both, are not harmful.  For options that require an argument, each du‐
       plication will override the previous argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
              This option is normally issued as the very first option and resets man's behaviour to its default.  Its use is to reset those options that  may  have
              been set in $MANOPT.  Any options that follow -D will have their usual effect.

       --warnings[=warnings]
              Enable  warnings  from  groff.   This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of manual pages.  warnings is a comma-separated list of
              warning names; if it is not supplied, the default is "mac".  See the “Warnings” node in info groff for a list of available warning names.

   Main modes of operation
       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent to whatis.  Display a short description from the manual page, if available.  See whatis(1) for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1) for details.

       -K, --global-apropos
              Search for text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time; if you can, you should specify a section to  re‐
              duce the number of pages that need to be searched.  Search terms may be simple strings (the default), or regular expressions if the --regex option is
              used.

              Note that this searches the sources of the manual pages, not the rendered text, and so may include false positives due to  things  like  comments  in
              source files.  Searching the rendered text would be much slower.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate "local" mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching through the system's manual collection.  Each manual page argument
              will be interpreted as an nroff source file in the correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the arguments, input will be
              taken  from stdin.  When this option is not used, and man fails to find the page required, before displaying the error message, it attempts to act as
              if this option was supplied, using the name as a filename and looking for an exact match.

       -w, --where, --path, --location
              Don't actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the source nroff file that would be formatted.  If the -a option is  also  used,
              then print the locations of all source files that match the search criteria.

       -W, --where-cat, --location-cat
              Don't  actually  display  the  manual page, but do print the location of the preformatted cat file that would be displayed.  If the -a option is also
              used, then print the locations of all preformatted cat files that match the search criteria.

              If -w and -W are both used, then print both source file and cat file separated by a space.  If all of -w, -W, and -a are used, then do this for  each
              possible match.

       -c, --catman
              This option is not for general use and should only be used by the catman program.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead  of  formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the specified encoding.  If you already know the encoding of
              the source file, you can also use manconv(1) directly.  However, this option allows you to convert several manual pages to a single encoding  without
              having to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they were already installed in a structure similar to a manual page hierarchy.

              Consider  using man-recode(1) instead for converting multiple manual pages, since it has an interface designed for bulk conversion and so can be much
              faster.

   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              man will normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which interrogates various environment  variables,  possibly
              including  $LC_MESSAGES  and  $LANG.   To temporarily override the determined value, use this option to supply a locale string directly to man.  Note
              that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such as the help message will always be displayed in  the  initially
              determined locale.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If this system has access to other operating system's manual pages, they can be accessed using this option.  To search for a manual page from NewOS's
              manual page collection, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include a search of the  native  operating  system's  manual
              pages, include the system name man in the argument string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify  an alternate manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath derived code to determine the path to search.  This option overrides the $MANPATH
              environment variable and causes option -m to be ignored.

              A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into sections as described in the man-db manual (under "The man‐
              ual page system").  To view manual pages outside such hierarchies, see the -l option.

       -S list, -s list, --sections=list
              The  given  list  is  a colon- or comma-separated list of sections, used to determine which manual sections to search and in what order.  This option
              overrides the $MANSECT environment variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility with System V.)

       -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension
              Some systems incorporate large packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the Tcl package, into the main manual page hierarchy.   To  get
              around  the  problem of having two manual pages with the same name such as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to section l.  As this is
              unfortunate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and to assign a specific "extension" to them, in this case, exit(3tcl).  Un‐
              der  normal  operation,  man will display exit(3) in preference to exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and to avoid having to know which section
              the page you require resides in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string indicating which package the page must belong to.   Using  the
              above example, supplying the option -e tcl to man will restrict the search to pages having an extension of *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       --regex
              Show  all  pages  with  any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument as a regular expression, as with apropos(1).
              Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a regular expression, this option implies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument using shell-style wildcards, as with  apropos(1)
              --wildcard.   The page argument must match the entire name or description, or match on word boundaries in the description.  Since there is usually no
              reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a wildcard, this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If the --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names, not page descriptions, as with whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By default, man will exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.  Using this option forces man to display all the manual pages with
              names that match the search criteria.

       -u, --update
              This option causes man to update its database caches of installed manual pages.  This is only needed in rare situations, and it is normally better to
              run mandb(8) instead.

       --no-subpages
              By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the command line as equivalent to a single manual page  name  containing  a
              hyphen  or an underscore.  This supports the common pattern of programs that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to provide manual pages
              for each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to invoke the subcommands themselves.  For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify which output pager to use.  By default, man uses pager, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.   This  option  over‐
              rides the $MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is not used in conjunction with -f or -k.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).  It may
              not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an  argument  or  on
              standard input.

       -r prompt, --prompt=prompt
              If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to set its prompt and some sensible options.  The default prompt looks like

               Manual page name(sec) line x

              where  name  denotes  the  manual page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x the current line number.  This is achieved by using the
              $LESS environment variable.

              Supplying -r with a string will override this default.  The string may contain the text $MAN_PN which will be expanded to the  name  of  the  current
              manual page and its section name surrounded by "(" and ")".  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              \ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:
              byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..
              (press h for help or q to quit)

              It is broken into three lines here for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the less(1) manual page.  The prompt string is first evalu‐
              ated by the shell.  All double quotes, back-quotes and backslashes in the prompt must be escaped by a preceding backslash.  The prompt string may end
              in an escaped $ which may be followed by further options for less.  By default man sets the -ix8 options.

              The $MANLESS environment variable described below may be used to set a default prompt string if none is supplied on the command line.

       -7, --ascii
              When viewing a pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may not display correctly when using the latin1(7)
              device description with GNU nroff.  This option allows pure ascii manual pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1 device.  It will  not  trans‐
              late  any  latin1 text.  The following table shows the translations performed: some parts of it may only be displayed properly when using GNU nroff's
              latin1(7) device.

              Description           Octal   latin1   ascii
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────
              continuation hyphen    255      ‐        -
              bullet (middle dot)    267      •        o
              acute accent           264      ´        '
              multiplication sign    327      ×        x

              If the latin1 column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters and this option is not necessary.  If the latin1 and ascii
              columns  are  identical,  you  are  reading  this page using this option or man did not format this page using the latin1 device description.  If the
              latin1 column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual pages with this option.

              This option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for nroff other than GNU's.

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward compatibility, encoding may be an nroff device such as ascii,  latin1,
              or utf8 as well as a true character encoding such as UTF-8.

       --no-hyphenation, --nh
              Normally,  nroff  will  automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not contain hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to lay out
              words on a line without excessive spacing.  This option disables automatic hyphenation, so words will only be hyphenated if they already contain  hy‐
              phens.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at an inappropriate point, do not use this option, but con‐
              sult the nroff documentation instead; for instance, you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at that point, or  put  "\%"
              at the start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.

       --no-justification, --nj
              Normally, nroff will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full justification, leaving justified only to the left margin,
              sometimes called "ragged-right" text.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain paragraphs, do not use this option, but consult  the  nroff
              documentation instead; for instance, you can use the ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting and filling.

       -p string, --preprocessor=string
              Specify  the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff/groff.  Not all installations will have a full set of preprocessors.  Some of the
              preprocessors and the letters used to designate them are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer  (r).   This  option  overrides  the
              $MANROFFSEQ environment variable.  zsoelim is always run as the very first preprocessor.

       -t, --troff
              Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This  option is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to be suitable for a device other than the default.  It implies -t.  Examples (pro‐
              vided with Groff-1.17) include dvi, latin1, ps, utf8, X75 and X100.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This option will cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web browser.  The choice of browser is determined by  the  op‐
              tional browser argument if one is provided, by the $BROWSER environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually lynx).  This
              option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.

       -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]
              This option displays the output of groff in a graphical window using the gxditview program.  The dpi (dots per  inch)  may  be  75,  75-12,  100,  or
              100-12,  defaulting  to  75; the -12 variants use a 12-point base font.  This option implies -T with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device respec‐
              tively.

       -Z, --ditroff
              groff will run troff and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for the chosen device.  If groff -mandoc  is  groff,  this
              option is passed to groff and will suppress the use of a post-processor.  It implies -t.

   Getting help
       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

       MANROFFOPT
              Every time man invokes the formatter (nroff, troff, or groff), it adds the contents of $MANROFFOPT to the formatter's command line.

       MANROFFSEQ
              If  $MANROFFSEQ  is  set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors to pass each manual page through.  The default preprocessor list is
              system dependent.

       MANSECT
              If $MANSECT is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and it is used to determine which manual sections to search and  in  what  order.
              The default is "1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7", unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              If  $MANPAGER  or  $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its value is used as the name of the program used to display the manual page.  By
              default, pager is used, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).  It may
              not  use  pipes  to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an argument or on
              standard input.

       MANLESS
              If $MANLESS is set, its value will be used as the default prompt string for the less pager, as if it had been passed using the -r option (so any  oc‐
              currences  of  the  text  $MAN_PN will be expanded in the same way).  For example, if you want to set the prompt string unconditionally to “my prompt
              string”, set $MANLESS to ‘-Psmy prompt string’.  Using the -r option overrides this environment variable.

       BROWSER
              If $BROWSER is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a web browser for man --html.   In
              each  command, %s is replaced by a filename containing the HTML output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and %c is replaced by
              a colon (:).

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m option.

       MANOPT If $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to be in a similar format.  As all of the other man  specific  envi‐
              ronment  variables  can be expressed as command line options, and are thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is expected that they will be‐
              come obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that should be interpreted as part of an option's argument must be escaped.

       MANWIDTH
              If $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be formatted.  If it is not set, manual pages will be format‐
              ted  with a line length appropriate to the current terminal (using the value of $COLUMNS, and ioctl(2) if available, or falling back to 80 characters
              if neither is available).  Cat pages will only be saved when the default formatting can be used, that is when the terminal line length is between  66
              and 80 characters.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              Normally,  when  output  is  not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are discarded to make it easier to
              read the result without special tools.  However, if $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING is set to any non-empty value, these  formatting  characters  are  retained.
              This may be useful for wrappers around man that can interpret formatting characters.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              Normally,  when  output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a pager), any error output from the command used to produce formatted versions of
              manual pages is discarded to avoid interfering with the pager's display.  Programs such as groff often produce relatively minor error messages  about
              typographical  problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally confusing when displayed along with the manual page.  However, some
              users want to see them anyway, so, if $MAN_KEEP_STDERR is set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed as usual.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              Depending on system and implementation, either or both of $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated for the current message locale.  man will  dis‐
              play its messages in that locale (if available).  See setlocale(3) for precise details.

SYNOPSIS
       mv [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
       mv [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
       mv [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...

DESCRIPTION
       Rename SOURCE to DEST, or move SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       --backup[=CONTROL]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

              do not prompt before overwriting

       -i, --interactive
              prompt before overwrite

       -n, --no-clobber
              do not overwrite an existing file

       If you specify more than one of -i, -f, -n, only the final one takes effect.

       --strip-trailing-slashes
              remove any trailing slashes from each SOURCE argument

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
              override the usual backup suffix

       -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              move all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY

       -T, --no-target-directory
              treat DEST as a normal file

       -u, --update
              move only when the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       -Z, --context
              set SELinux security context of destination file to default type

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       The  backup  suffix is '~', unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may be selected via the --backup option or through
       the VERSION_CONTROL environment variable.  Here are the values:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

NAME
       man - an interface to the system reference manuals

SYNOPSIS
       man [man options] [[section] page ...] ...
       man -k [apropos options] regexp ...
       man -K [man options] [section] term ...
       man -f [whatis options] page ...
       man -l [man options] file ...
       man -w|-W [man options] page ...

DESCRIPTION
       man  is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associated with
       each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of the manual.  The  default  ac‐
       tion  is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found, even if page exists
       in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE,  ERRORS,  ENVIRONMENT,  FILES,  VERSIONS,
       CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact  rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render italics when running in a terminal, and will
       typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable to illustrate several exclusive
       invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

       man man.7
           Display the manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is an alternative spelling of "man 7 man".)

       man 'man(7)'
           Display  the  manual  page  for macro package man from section 7.  (This is another alternative spelling of "man 7 man".  It may be more convenient when
           copying and pasting cross-references to manual pages.  Note that the parentheses must normally be quoted to protect them from the shell.)

       man -a intro
           Display, in succession, all of the available intro manual pages contained within the manual.  It is possible to quit between successive displays or skip
           any of them.

       man -t bash | lpr -Pps
           Format  the  manual  page  for bash into the default troff or groff format and pipe it to the printer named ps.  The default output for groff is usually
           PostScript.  man --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.

       man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a device independent (dvi) file.  The redirection is necessary  as
           the  -T  flag  causes  output  to be directed to stdout with no pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi or further processed into
           PostScript using a program such as dvips.

       man -k printf
           Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.  Print out any matches.  Equivalent to apropos printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short descriptions of any found.  Equivalent to whatis smail.

OVERVIEW
       Many options are available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes can be made to the search path, section order, out‐
       put processor, and other behaviours and operations detailed below.

       If  set,  various  environment  variables are interrogated to determine the operation of man.  It is possible to set the "catch-all" variable $MANOPT to any
       string in command line format, with the exception that any spaces used as part of an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).  man  will
       parse  $MANOPT prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options requiring an argument will be overridden by the same options found on the command line.
       To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be specified as the initial command line option.  This will allow man to "forget" about the options spec‐
       ified in $MANOPT, although they must still have been valid.

       Manual  pages  are  normally  stored in nroff(1) format under a directory such as /usr/share/man.  In some installations, there may also be preformatted cat
       pages to improve performance.  See manpath(5) for details of where these files are stored.

       This package supports manual pages in multiple languages, controlled by your locale.  If your system did not set this up for you automatically, then you may
       need to set $LC_MESSAGES, $LANG, or another system-dependent environment variable to indicate your preferred locale, usually specified in the POSIX format:

       <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your locale, it will be displayed in lieu of the standard (usually American English) page.

       If you find that the translations supplied with this package are not available in your native language and you would like to supply them, please contact the
       maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.

       Individual manual pages are normally written and maintained by the maintainers of the program, function, or other topic that they document, and are not  in‐
       cluded with this package.  If you find that a manual page is missing or inadequate, please report that to the maintainers of the package in question.

       For information regarding other features and extensions available with this manual pager, please read the documents supplied with the package.

DEFAULTS
       The order of sections to search may be overridden by the environment variable $MANSECT or by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.  By default it is
       as follows:

              1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7

       The formatted manual page is displayed using a pager.  This can be specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default (see option -P for de‐
       tails).

       The  filters  are  deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line option -p or the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is interrogated.  If -p was
       not used and the environment variable was not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain a valid  preprocessor
       string, the first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A  formatting  pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable pro‐
       gram mandb_nfmt (or mandb_tfmt with -t) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets  passed  the  manual  source  file,  the  preprocessor
       string, and optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non-argument  options  that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both, are not harmful.  For options that require an argument, each du‐
       plication will override the previous argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
              This option is normally issued as the very first option and resets man's behaviour to its default.  Its use is to reset those options that  may  have
              been set in $MANOPT.  Any options that follow -D will have their usual effect.

       --warnings[=warnings]
              Enable  warnings  from  groff.   This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of manual pages.  warnings is a comma-separated list of
              warning names; if it is not supplied, the default is "mac".  See the “Warnings” node in info groff for a list of available warning names.

   Main modes of operation
       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent to whatis.  Display a short description from the manual page, if available.  See whatis(1) for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1) for details.

       -K, --global-apropos
              Search for text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time; if you can, you should specify a section to  re‐
              duce the number of pages that need to be searched.  Search terms may be simple strings (the default), or regular expressions if the --regex option is
              used.

              Note that this searches the sources of the manual pages, not the rendered text, and so may include false positives due to  things  like  comments  in
              source files.  Searching the rendered text would be much slower.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate "local" mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching through the system's manual collection.  Each manual page argument
              will be interpreted as an nroff source file in the correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the arguments, input will be
              taken  from stdin.  When this option is not used, and man fails to find the page required, before displaying the error message, it attempts to act as
              if this option was supplied, using the name as a filename and looking for an exact match.

       -w, --where, --path, --location
              Don't actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the source nroff file that would be formatted.  If the -a option is  also  used,
              then print the locations of all source files that match the search criteria.

       -W, --where-cat, --location-cat
              Don't  actually  display  the  manual page, but do print the location of the preformatted cat file that would be displayed.  If the -a option is also
              used, then print the locations of all preformatted cat files that match the search criteria.

              If -w and -W are both used, then print both source file and cat file separated by a space.  If all of -w, -W, and -a are used, then do this for  each
              possible match.

       -c, --catman
              This option is not for general use and should only be used by the catman program.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead  of  formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the specified encoding.  If you already know the encoding of
              the source file, you can also use manconv(1) directly.  However, this option allows you to convert several manual pages to a single encoding  without
              having to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they were already installed in a structure similar to a manual page hierarchy.

              Consider  using man-recode(1) instead for converting multiple manual pages, since it has an interface designed for bulk conversion and so can be much
              faster.

   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              man will normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which interrogates various environment  variables,  possibly
              including  $LC_MESSAGES  and  $LANG.   To temporarily override the determined value, use this option to supply a locale string directly to man.  Note
              that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such as the help message will always be displayed in  the  initially
              determined locale.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If this system has access to other operating system's manual pages, they can be accessed using this option.  To search for a manual page from NewOS's
              manual page collection, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include a search of the  native  operating  system's  manual
              pages, include the system name man in the argument string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify  an alternate manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath derived code to determine the path to search.  This option overrides the $MANPATH
              environment variable and causes option -m to be ignored.

              A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into sections as described in the man-db manual (under "The man‐
              ual page system").  To view manual pages outside such hierarchies, see the -l option.

       -S list, -s list, --sections=list
              The  given  list  is  a colon- or comma-separated list of sections, used to determine which manual sections to search and in what order.  This option
              overrides the $MANSECT environment variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility with System V.)

       -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension
              Some systems incorporate large packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the Tcl package, into the main manual page hierarchy.   To  get
              around  the  problem of having two manual pages with the same name such as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to section l.  As this is
              unfortunate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and to assign a specific "extension" to them, in this case, exit(3tcl).  Un‐
              der  normal  operation,  man will display exit(3) in preference to exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and to avoid having to know which section
              the page you require resides in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string indicating which package the page must belong to.   Using  the
              above example, supplying the option -e tcl to man will restrict the search to pages having an extension of *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       --regex
              Show  all  pages  with  any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument as a regular expression, as with apropos(1).
              Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a regular expression, this option implies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument using shell-style wildcards, as with  apropos(1)
              --wildcard.   The page argument must match the entire name or description, or match on word boundaries in the description.  Since there is usually no
              reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a wildcard, this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If the --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names, not page descriptions, as with whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By default, man will exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.  Using this option forces man to display all the manual pages with
              names that match the search criteria.

       -u, --update
              This option causes man to update its database caches of installed manual pages.  This is only needed in rare situations, and it is normally better to
              run mandb(8) instead.

       --no-subpages
              By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the command line as equivalent to a single manual page  name  containing  a
              hyphen  or an underscore.  This supports the common pattern of programs that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to provide manual pages
              for each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to invoke the subcommands themselves.  For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify which output pager to use.  By default, man uses pager, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.   This  option  over‐
              rides the $MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is not used in conjunction with -f or -k.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).  It may
              not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an  argument  or  on
              standard input.

       -r prompt, --prompt=prompt
              If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to set its prompt and some sensible options.  The default prompt looks like

               Manual page name(sec) line x

              where  name  denotes  the  manual page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x the current line number.  This is achieved by using the
              $LESS environment variable.

              Supplying -r with a string will override this default.  The string may contain the text $MAN_PN which will be expanded to the  name  of  the  current
              manual page and its section name surrounded by "(" and ")".  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              \ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:
              byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..
              (press h for help or q to quit)

              It is broken into three lines here for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the less(1) manual page.  The prompt string is first evalu‐
              ated by the shell.  All double quotes, back-quotes and backslashes in the prompt must be escaped by a preceding backslash.  The prompt string may end
              in an escaped $ which may be followed by further options for less.  By default man sets the -ix8 options.

              The $MANLESS environment variable described below may be used to set a default prompt string if none is supplied on the command line.

       -7, --ascii
              When viewing a pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may not display correctly when using the latin1(7)
              device description with GNU nroff.  This option allows pure ascii manual pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1 device.  It will  not  trans‐
              late  any  latin1 text.  The following table shows the translations performed: some parts of it may only be displayed properly when using GNU nroff's
              latin1(7) device.

              Description           Octal   latin1   ascii
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────
              continuation hyphen    255      ‐        -
              bullet (middle dot)    267      •        o
              acute accent           264      ´        '
              multiplication sign    327      ×        x

              If the latin1 column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters and this option is not necessary.  If the latin1 and ascii
              columns  are  identical,  you  are  reading  this page using this option or man did not format this page using the latin1 device description.  If the
              latin1 column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual pages with this option.

              This option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for nroff other than GNU's.

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward compatibility, encoding may be an nroff device such as ascii,  latin1,
              or utf8 as well as a true character encoding such as UTF-8.

       --no-hyphenation, --nh
              Normally,  nroff  will  automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not contain hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to lay out
              words on a line without excessive spacing.  This option disables automatic hyphenation, so words will only be hyphenated if they already contain  hy‐
              phens.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at an inappropriate point, do not use this option, but con‐
              sult the nroff documentation instead; for instance, you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at that point, or  put  "\%"
              at the start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.

       --no-justification, --nj
              Normally, nroff will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full justification, leaving justified only to the left margin,
              sometimes called "ragged-right" text.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain paragraphs, do not use this option, but consult  the  nroff
              documentation instead; for instance, you can use the ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting and filling.

       -p string, --preprocessor=string
              Specify  the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff/groff.  Not all installations will have a full set of preprocessors.  Some of the
              preprocessors and the letters used to designate them are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer  (r).   This  option  overrides  the
              $MANROFFSEQ environment variable.  zsoelim is always run as the very first preprocessor.

       -t, --troff
              Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This  option is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to be suitable for a device other than the default.  It implies -t.  Examples (pro‐
              vided with Groff-1.17) include dvi, latin1, ps, utf8, X75 and X100.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This option will cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web browser.  The choice of browser is determined by  the  op‐
              tional browser argument if one is provided, by the $BROWSER environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually lynx).  This
              option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.

       -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]
              This option displays the output of groff in a graphical window using the gxditview program.  The dpi (dots per  inch)  may  be  75,  75-12,  100,  or
              100-12,  defaulting  to  75; the -12 variants use a 12-point base font.  This option implies -T with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device respec‐
              tively.

       -Z, --ditroff
              groff will run troff and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for the chosen device.  If groff -mandoc  is  groff,  this
              option is passed to groff and will suppress the use of a post-processor.  It implies -t.

   Getting help
       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

       MANROFFOPT
              Every time man invokes the formatter (nroff, troff, or groff), it adds the contents of $MANROFFOPT to the formatter's command line.

       MANROFFSEQ
              If  $MANROFFSEQ  is  set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors to pass each manual page through.  The default preprocessor list is
              system dependent.

       MANSECT
              If $MANSECT is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and it is used to determine which manual sections to search and  in  what  order.
              The default is "1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7", unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              If  $MANPAGER  or  $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its value is used as the name of the program used to display the manual page.  By
              default, pager is used, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).  It may
              not  use  pipes  to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an argument or on
              standard input.

       MANLESS
              If $MANLESS is set, its value will be used as the default prompt string for the less pager, as if it had been passed using the -r option (so any  oc‐
              currences  of  the  text  $MAN_PN will be expanded in the same way).  For example, if you want to set the prompt string unconditionally to “my prompt
              string”, set $MANLESS to ‘-Psmy prompt string’.  Using the -r option overrides this environment variable.

       BROWSER
              If $BROWSER is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a web browser for man --html.   In
              each  command, %s is replaced by a filename containing the HTML output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and %c is replaced by
              a colon (:).

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m option.

       MANOPT If $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to be in a similar format.  As all of the other man  specific  envi‐
              ronment  variables  can be expressed as command line options, and are thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is expected that they will be‐
              come obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that should be interpreted as part of an option's argument must be escaped.

       MANWIDTH
              If $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be formatted.  If it is not set, manual pages will be format‐
              ted  with a line length appropriate to the current terminal (using the value of $COLUMNS, and ioctl(2) if available, or falling back to 80 characters
              if neither is available).  Cat pages will only be saved when the default formatting can be used, that is when the terminal line length is between  66
              and 80 characters.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              Normally,  when  output  is  not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are discarded to make it easier to
              read the result without special tools.  However, if $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING is set to any non-empty value, these  formatting  characters  are  retained.
              This may be useful for wrappers around man that can interpret formatting characters.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              Normally,  when  output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a pager), any error output from the command used to produce formatted versions of
              manual pages is discarded to avoid interfering with the pager's display.  Programs such as groff often produce relatively minor error messages  about
              typographical  problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally confusing when displayed along with the manual page.  However, some
              users want to see them anyway, so, if $MAN_KEEP_STDERR is set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed as usual.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              Depending on system and implementation, either or both of $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated for the current message locale.  man will  dis‐
              play its messages in that locale (if available).  See setlocale(3) for precise details.

       /etc/manpath.config

NAME
       man - an interface to the system reference manuals

SYNOPSIS
       man [man options] [[section] page ...] ...
       man -k [apropos options] regexp ...
       man -K [man options] [section] term ...
       man -f [whatis options] page ...
       man -l [man options] file ...
       man -w|-W [man options] page ...

DESCRIPTION
       man  is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associated with
       each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of the manual.  The  default  ac‐
       tion  is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found, even if page exists
       in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE,  ERRORS,  ENVIRONMENT,  FILES,  VERSIONS,
       CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact  rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render italics when running in a terminal, and will
       typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable to illustrate several exclusive
       invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

       man man.7
           Display the manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is an alternative spelling of "man 7 man".)

       man 'man(7)'
           Display  the  manual  page  for macro package man from section 7.  (This is another alternative spelling of "man 7 man".  It may be more convenient when
           copying and pasting cross-references to manual pages.  Note that the parentheses must normally be quoted to protect them from the shell.)

       man -a intro
           Display, in succession, all of the available intro manual pages contained within the manual.  It is possible to quit between successive displays or skip
           any of them.

       man -t bash | lpr -Pps
           Format  the  manual  page  for bash into the default troff or groff format and pipe it to the printer named ps.  The default output for groff is usually
           PostScript.  man --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.

       man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a device independent (dvi) file.  The redirection is necessary  as
           the  -T  flag  causes  output  to be directed to stdout with no pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi or further processed into
           PostScript using a program such as dvips.

       man -k printf
           Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.  Print out any matches.  Equivalent to apropos printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short descriptions of any found.  Equivalent to whatis smail.

OVERVIEW
       Many options are available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes can be made to the search path, section order, out‐
       put processor, and other behaviours and operations detailed below.

       If  set,  various  environment  variables are interrogated to determine the operation of man.  It is possible to set the "catch-all" variable $MANOPT to any
       string in command line format, with the exception that any spaces used as part of an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).  man  will
       parse  $MANOPT prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options requiring an argument will be overridden by the same options found on the command line.
       To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be specified as the initial command line option.  This will allow man to "forget" about the options spec‐
       ified in $MANOPT, although they must still have been valid.

       Manual  pages  are  normally  stored in nroff(1) format under a directory such as /usr/share/man.  In some installations, there may also be preformatted cat
       pages to improve performance.  See manpath(5) for details of where these files are stored.

       This package supports manual pages in multiple languages, controlled by your locale.  If your system did not set this up for you automatically, then you may
       need to set $LC_MESSAGES, $LANG, or another system-dependent environment variable to indicate your preferred locale, usually specified in the POSIX format:

       <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your locale, it will be displayed in lieu of the standard (usually American English) page.

       If you find that the translations supplied with this package are not available in your native language and you would like to supply them, please contact the
       maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.

       Individual manual pages are normally written and maintained by the maintainers of the program, function, or other topic that they document, and are not  in‐
       cluded with this package.  If you find that a manual page is missing or inadequate, please report that to the maintainers of the package in question.

       For information regarding other features and extensions available with this manual pager, please read the documents supplied with the package.

DEFAULTS
       The order of sections to search may be overridden by the environment variable $MANSECT or by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.  By default it is
       as follows:

              1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7

       The formatted manual page is displayed using a pager.  This can be specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default (see option -P for de‐
       tails).

       The  filters  are  deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line option -p or the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is interrogated.  If -p was
       not used and the environment variable was not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain a valid  preprocessor
       string, the first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A  formatting  pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable pro‐
       gram mandb_nfmt (or mandb_tfmt with -t) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets  passed  the  manual  source  file,  the  preprocessor
       string, and optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non-argument  options  that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both, are not harmful.  For options that require an argument, each du‐
       plication will override the previous argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
              This option is normally issued as the very first option and resets man's behaviour to its default.  Its use is to reset those options that  may  have
              been set in $MANOPT.  Any options that follow -D will have their usual effect.

       --warnings[=warnings]
              Enable  warnings  from  groff.   This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of manual pages.  warnings is a comma-separated list of
              warning names; if it is not supplied, the default is "mac".  See the “Warnings” node in info groff for a list of available warning names.

   Main modes of operation
       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent to whatis.  Display a short description from the manual page, if available.  See whatis(1) for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1) for details.

       -K, --global-apropos
              Search for text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time; if you can, you should specify a section to  re‐
              duce the number of pages that need to be searched.  Search terms may be simple strings (the default), or regular expressions if the --regex option is
              used.

              Note that this searches the sources of the manual pages, not the rendered text, and so may include false positives due to  things  like  comments  in
              source files.  Searching the rendered text would be much slower.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate "local" mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching through the system's manual collection.  Each manual page argument
              will be interpreted as an nroff source file in the correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the arguments, input will be
              taken  from stdin.  When this option is not used, and man fails to find the page required, before displaying the error message, it attempts to act as
              if this option was supplied, using the name as a filename and looking for an exact match.

       -w, --where, --path, --location
              Don't actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the source nroff file that would be formatted.  If the -a option is  also  used,
              then print the locations of all source files that match the search criteria.

       -W, --where-cat, --location-cat
              Don't  actually  display  the  manual page, but do print the location of the preformatted cat file that would be displayed.  If the -a option is also
              used, then print the locations of all preformatted cat files that match the search criteria.

              If -w and -W are both used, then print both source file and cat file separated by a space.  If all of -w, -W, and -a are used, then do this for  each
              possible match.

       -c, --catman
              This option is not for general use and should only be used by the catman program.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead  of  formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the specified encoding.  If you already know the encoding of
              the source file, you can also use manconv(1) directly.  However, this option allows you to convert several manual pages to a single encoding  without
              having to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they were already installed in a structure similar to a manual page hierarchy.

              Consider  using man-recode(1) instead for converting multiple manual pages, since it has an interface designed for bulk conversion and so can be much
              faster.

   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              man will normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which interrogates various environment  variables,  possibly
              including  $LC_MESSAGES  and  $LANG.   To temporarily override the determined value, use this option to supply a locale string directly to man.  Note
              that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such as the help message will always be displayed in  the  initially
              determined locale.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If this system has access to other operating system's manual pages, they can be accessed using this option.  To search for a manual page from NewOS's
              manual page collection, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include a search of the  native  operating  system's  manual
              pages, include the system name man in the argument string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify  an alternate manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath derived code to determine the path to search.  This option overrides the $MANPATH
              environment variable and causes option -m to be ignored.

              A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into sections as described in the man-db manual (under "The man‐
              ual page system").  To view manual pages outside such hierarchies, see the -l option.

       -S list, -s list, --sections=list
              The  given  list  is  a colon- or comma-separated list of sections, used to determine which manual sections to search and in what order.  This option
              overrides the $MANSECT environment variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility with System V.)

       -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension
              Some systems incorporate large packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the Tcl package, into the main manual page hierarchy.   To  get
              around  the  problem of having two manual pages with the same name such as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to section l.  As this is
              unfortunate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and to assign a specific "extension" to them, in this case, exit(3tcl).  Un‐
              der  normal  operation,  man will display exit(3) in preference to exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and to avoid having to know which section
              the page you require resides in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string indicating which package the page must belong to.   Using  the
              above example, supplying the option -e tcl to man will restrict the search to pages having an extension of *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       --regex
              Show  all  pages  with  any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument as a regular expression, as with apropos(1).
              Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a regular expression, this option implies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument using shell-style wildcards, as with  apropos(1)
              --wildcard.   The page argument must match the entire name or description, or match on word boundaries in the description.  Since there is usually no
              reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a wildcard, this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If the --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names, not page descriptions, as with whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By default, man will exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.  Using this option forces man to display all the manual pages with
              names that match the search criteria.

       -u, --update
              This option causes man to update its database caches of installed manual pages.  This is only needed in rare situations, and it is normally better to
              run mandb(8) instead.

       --no-subpages
              By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the command line as equivalent to a single manual page  name  containing  a
              hyphen  or an underscore.  This supports the common pattern of programs that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to provide manual pages
              for each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to invoke the subcommands themselves.  For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify which output pager to use.  By default, man uses pager, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.   This  option  over‐
              rides the $MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is not used in conjunction with -f or -k.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).  It may
              not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an  argument  or  on
              standard input.

       -r prompt, --prompt=prompt
              If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to set its prompt and some sensible options.  The default prompt looks like

               Manual page name(sec) line x

              where  name  denotes  the  manual page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x the current line number.  This is achieved by using the
              $LESS environment variable.

              Supplying -r with a string will override this default.  The string may contain the text $MAN_PN which will be expanded to the  name  of  the  current
              manual page and its section name surrounded by "(" and ")".  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              \ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:
              byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..
              (press h for help or q to quit)

              It is broken into three lines here for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the less(1) manual page.  The prompt string is first evalu‐
              ated by the shell.  All double quotes, back-quotes and backslashes in the prompt must be escaped by a preceding backslash.  The prompt string may end
              in an escaped $ which may be followed by further options for less.  By default man sets the -ix8 options.

              The $MANLESS environment variable described below may be used to set a default prompt string if none is supplied on the command line.

       -7, --ascii
              When viewing a pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may not display correctly when using the latin1(7)
              device description with GNU nroff.  This option allows pure ascii manual pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1 device.  It will  not  trans‐
              late  any  latin1 text.  The following table shows the translations performed: some parts of it may only be displayed properly when using GNU nroff's
              latin1(7) device.

              Description           Octal   latin1   ascii
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────
              continuation hyphen    255      ‐        -
              bullet (middle dot)    267      •        o
              acute accent           264      ´        '
              multiplication sign    327      ×        x

              If the latin1 column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters and this option is not necessary.  If the latin1 and ascii
              columns  are  identical,  you  are  reading  this page using this option or man did not format this page using the latin1 device description.  If the
              latin1 column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual pages with this option.

              This option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for nroff other than GNU's.

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward compatibility, encoding may be an nroff device such as ascii,  latin1,
              or utf8 as well as a true character encoding such as UTF-8.

       --no-hyphenation, --nh
              Normally,  nroff  will  automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not contain hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to lay out
              words on a line without excessive spacing.  This option disables automatic hyphenation, so words will only be hyphenated if they already contain  hy‐
              phens.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at an inappropriate point, do not use this option, but con‐
              sult the nroff documentation instead; for instance, you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at that point, or  put  "\%"
              at the start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.

       --no-justification, --nj
              Normally, nroff will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full justification, leaving justified only to the left margin,
              sometimes called "ragged-right" text.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain paragraphs, do not use this option, but consult  the  nroff
              documentation instead; for instance, you can use the ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting and filling.

       -p string, --preprocessor=string
              Specify  the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff/groff.  Not all installations will have a full set of preprocessors.  Some of the
              preprocessors and the letters used to designate them are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer  (r).   This  option  overrides  the
              $MANROFFSEQ environment variable.  zsoelim is always run as the very first preprocessor.

       -t, --troff
              Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This  option is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to be suitable for a device other than the default.  It implies -t.  Examples (pro‐
              vided with Groff-1.17) include dvi, latin1, ps, utf8, X75 and X100.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This option will cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web browser.  The choice of browser is determined by  the  op‐
              tional browser argument if one is provided, by the $BROWSER environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually lynx).  This
              option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.

       -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]
              This option displays the output of groff in a graphical window using the gxditview program.  The dpi (dots per  inch)  may  be  75,  75-12,  100,  or
              100-12,  defaulting  to  75; the -12 variants use a 12-point base font.  This option implies -T with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device respec‐
              tively.

       -Z, --ditroff
              groff will run troff and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for the chosen device.  If groff -mandoc  is  groff,  this
              option is passed to groff and will suppress the use of a post-processor.  It implies -t.

   Getting help
       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

       MANROFFOPT
              Every time man invokes the formatter (nroff, troff, or groff), it adds the contents of $MANROFFOPT to the formatter's command line.

       MANROFFSEQ
              If  $MANROFFSEQ  is  set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors to pass each manual page through.  The default preprocessor list is
              system dependent.

       MANSECT
              If $MANSECT is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and it is used to determine which manual sections to search and  in  what  order.
              The default is "1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7", unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              If  $MANPAGER  or  $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its value is used as the name of the program used to display the manual page.  By
              default, pager is used, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).  It may
              not  use  pipes  to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an argument or on
              standard input.

       MANLESS
              If $MANLESS is set, its value will be used as the default prompt string for the less pager, as if it had been passed using the -r option (so any  oc‐
              currences  of  the  text  $MAN_PN will be expanded in the same way).  For example, if you want to set the prompt string unconditionally to “my prompt
              string”, set $MANLESS to ‘-Psmy prompt string’.  Using the -r option overrides this environment variable.

       BROWSER
              If $BROWSER is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a web browser for man --html.   In
              each  command, %s is replaced by a filename containing the HTML output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and %c is replaced by
              a colon (:).

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m option.

       MANOPT If $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to be in a similar format.  As all of the other man  specific  envi‐
              ronment  variables  can be expressed as command line options, and are thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is expected that they will be‐
              come obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that should be interpreted as part of an option's argument must be escaped.

       MANWIDTH
              If $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be formatted.  If it is not set, manual pages will be format‐
              ted  with a line length appropriate to the current terminal (using the value of $COLUMNS, and ioctl(2) if available, or falling back to 80 characters
              if neither is available).  Cat pages will only be saved when the default formatting can be used, that is when the terminal line length is between  66
              and 80 characters.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              Normally,  when  output  is  not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are discarded to make it easier to
              read the result without special tools.  However, if $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING is set to any non-empty value, these  formatting  characters  are  retained.
              This may be useful for wrappers around man that can interpret formatting characters.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              Normally,  when  output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a pager), any error output from the command used to produce formatted versions of
              manual pages is discarded to avoid interfering with the pager's display.  Programs such as groff often produce relatively minor error messages  about
              typographical  problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally confusing when displayed along with the manual page.  However, some
              users want to see them anyway, so, if $MAN_KEEP_STDERR is set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed as usual.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              Depending on system and implementation, either or both of $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated for the current message locale.  man will  dis‐
              play its messages in that locale (if available).  See setlocale(3) for precise details.

FILES
       /etc/manpath.config
              man-db configuration file.

NAME
       man - an interface to the system reference manuals

SYNOPSIS
       man [man options] [[section] page ...] ...
       man -k [apropos options] regexp ...
       man -K [man options] [section] term ...
       man -f [whatis options] page ...
       man -l [man options] file ...
       man -w|-W [man options] page ...

DESCRIPTION
       man  is the system's manual pager.  Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associated with
       each of these arguments is then found and displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of the manual.  The  default  ac‐
       tion  is to search in all of the available sections following a pre-defined order (see DEFAULTS), and to show only the first page found, even if page exists
       in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.

       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE,  ERRORS,  ENVIRONMENT,  FILES,  VERSIONS,
       CONFORMING TO, NOTES, BUGS, EXAMPLE, AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.

       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact  rendering may vary depending on the output device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render italics when running in a terminal, and will
       typically use underlined or coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable to illustrate several exclusive
       invocations as is shown in the SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

       man man.7
           Display the manual page for macro package man from section 7.  (This is an alternative spelling of "man 7 man".)

       man 'man(7)'
           Display  the  manual  page  for macro package man from section 7.  (This is another alternative spelling of "man 7 man".  It may be more convenient when
           copying and pasting cross-references to manual pages.  Note that the parentheses must normally be quoted to protect them from the shell.)

       man -a intro
           Display, in succession, all of the available intro manual pages contained within the manual.  It is possible to quit between successive displays or skip
           any of them.

       man -t bash | lpr -Pps
           Format  the  manual  page  for bash into the default troff or groff format and pipe it to the printer named ps.  The default output for groff is usually
           PostScript.  man --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.

       man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a device independent (dvi) file.  The redirection is necessary  as
           the  -T  flag  causes  output  to be directed to stdout with no pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi or further processed into
           PostScript using a program such as dvips.

       man -k printf
           Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.  Print out any matches.  Equivalent to apropos printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short descriptions of any found.  Equivalent to whatis smail.

OVERVIEW
       Many options are available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes can be made to the search path, section order, out‐
       put processor, and other behaviours and operations detailed below.

       If  set,  various  environment  variables are interrogated to determine the operation of man.  It is possible to set the "catch-all" variable $MANOPT to any
       string in command line format, with the exception that any spaces used as part of an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).  man  will
       parse  $MANOPT prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options requiring an argument will be overridden by the same options found on the command line.
       To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be specified as the initial command line option.  This will allow man to "forget" about the options spec‐
       ified in $MANOPT, although they must still have been valid.

       Manual  pages  are  normally  stored in nroff(1) format under a directory such as /usr/share/man.  In some installations, there may also be preformatted cat
       pages to improve performance.  See manpath(5) for details of where these files are stored.

       This package supports manual pages in multiple languages, controlled by your locale.  If your system did not set this up for you automatically, then you may
       need to set $LC_MESSAGES, $LANG, or another system-dependent environment variable to indicate your preferred locale, usually specified in the POSIX format:

       <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your locale, it will be displayed in lieu of the standard (usually American English) page.

       If you find that the translations supplied with this package are not available in your native language and you would like to supply them, please contact the
       maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.

       Individual manual pages are normally written and maintained by the maintainers of the program, function, or other topic that they document, and are not  in‐
       cluded with this package.  If you find that a manual page is missing or inadequate, please report that to the maintainers of the package in question.

       For information regarding other features and extensions available with this manual pager, please read the documents supplied with the package.

DEFAULTS
       The order of sections to search may be overridden by the environment variable $MANSECT or by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.  By default it is
       as follows:

              1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7

       The formatted manual page is displayed using a pager.  This can be specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default (see option -P for de‐
       tails).

       The  filters  are  deciphered by a number of means.  Firstly, the command line option -p or the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is interrogated.  If -p was
       not used and the environment variable was not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain a valid  preprocessor
       string, the first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A  formatting  pipeline is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable pro‐
       gram mandb_nfmt (or mandb_tfmt with -t) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets  passed  the  manual  source  file,  the  preprocessor
       string, and optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non-argument  options  that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both, are not harmful.  For options that require an argument, each du‐
       plication will override the previous argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
              This option is normally issued as the very first option and resets man's behaviour to its default.  Its use is to reset those options that  may  have
              been set in $MANOPT.  Any options that follow -D will have their usual effect.

       --warnings[=warnings]
              Enable  warnings  from  groff.   This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of manual pages.  warnings is a comma-separated list of
              warning names; if it is not supplied, the default is "mac".  See the “Warnings” node in info groff for a list of available warning names.

   Main modes of operation
       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent to whatis.  Display a short description from the manual page, if available.  See whatis(1) for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1) for details.

       -K, --global-apropos
              Search for text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time; if you can, you should specify a section to  re‐
              duce the number of pages that need to be searched.  Search terms may be simple strings (the default), or regular expressions if the --regex option is
              used.

              Note that this searches the sources of the manual pages, not the rendered text, and so may include false positives due to  things  like  comments  in
              source files.  Searching the rendered text would be much slower.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate "local" mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching through the system's manual collection.  Each manual page argument
              will be interpreted as an nroff source file in the correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the arguments, input will be
              taken  from stdin.  When this option is not used, and man fails to find the page required, before displaying the error message, it attempts to act as
              if this option was supplied, using the name as a filename and looking for an exact match.

       -w, --where, --path, --location
              Don't actually display the manual page, but do print the location of the source nroff file that would be formatted.  If the -a option is  also  used,
              then print the locations of all source files that match the search criteria.

       -W, --where-cat, --location-cat
              Don't  actually  display  the  manual page, but do print the location of the preformatted cat file that would be displayed.  If the -a option is also
              used, then print the locations of all preformatted cat files that match the search criteria.

              If -w and -W are both used, then print both source file and cat file separated by a space.  If all of -w, -W, and -a are used, then do this for  each
              possible match.

       -c, --catman
              This option is not for general use and should only be used by the catman program.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead  of  formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the specified encoding.  If you already know the encoding of
              the source file, you can also use manconv(1) directly.  However, this option allows you to convert several manual pages to a single encoding  without
              having to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they were already installed in a structure similar to a manual page hierarchy.

              Consider  using man-recode(1) instead for converting multiple manual pages, since it has an interface designed for bulk conversion and so can be much
              faster.

   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              man will normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which interrogates various environment  variables,  possibly
              including  $LC_MESSAGES  and  $LANG.   To temporarily override the determined value, use this option to supply a locale string directly to man.  Note
              that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.  Output such as the help message will always be displayed in  the  initially
              determined locale.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If this system has access to other operating system's manual pages, they can be accessed using this option.  To search for a manual page from NewOS's
              manual page collection, use the option -m NewOS.

              The system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include a search of the  native  operating  system's  manual
              pages, include the system name man in the argument string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify  an alternate manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath derived code to determine the path to search.  This option overrides the $MANPATH
              environment variable and causes option -m to be ignored.

              A path specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into sections as described in the man-db manual (under "The man‐
              ual page system").  To view manual pages outside such hierarchies, see the -l option.

       -S list, -s list, --sections=list
              The  given  list  is  a colon- or comma-separated list of sections, used to determine which manual sections to search and in what order.  This option
              overrides the $MANSECT environment variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility with System V.)

       -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension
              Some systems incorporate large packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the Tcl package, into the main manual page hierarchy.   To  get
              around  the  problem of having two manual pages with the same name such as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to section l.  As this is
              unfortunate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct section, and to assign a specific "extension" to them, in this case, exit(3tcl).  Un‐
              der  normal  operation,  man will display exit(3) in preference to exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situation and to avoid having to know which section
              the page you require resides in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string indicating which package the page must belong to.   Using  the
              above example, supplying the option -e tcl to man will restrict the search to pages having an extension of *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       --regex
              Show  all  pages  with  any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument as a regular expression, as with apropos(1).
              Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a regular expression, this option implies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument using shell-style wildcards, as with  apropos(1)
              --wildcard.   The page argument must match the entire name or description, or match on word boundaries in the description.  Since there is usually no
              reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a wildcard, this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If the --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names, not page descriptions, as with whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By default, man will exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.  Using this option forces man to display all the manual pages with
              names that match the search criteria.

       -u, --update
              This option causes man to update its database caches of installed manual pages.  This is only needed in rare situations, and it is normally better to
              run mandb(8) instead.

       --no-subpages
              By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the command line as equivalent to a single manual page  name  containing  a
              hyphen  or an underscore.  This supports the common pattern of programs that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to provide manual pages
              for each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used to invoke the subcommands themselves.  For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify which output pager to use.  By default, man uses pager, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.   This  option  over‐
              rides the $MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the $PAGER environment variable.  It is not used in conjunction with -f or -k.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).  It may
              not use pipes to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an  argument  or  on
              standard input.

       -r prompt, --prompt=prompt
              If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to set its prompt and some sensible options.  The default prompt looks like

               Manual page name(sec) line x

              where  name  denotes  the  manual page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x the current line number.  This is achieved by using the
              $LESS environment variable.

              Supplying -r with a string will override this default.  The string may contain the text $MAN_PN which will be expanded to the  name  of  the  current
              manual page and its section name surrounded by "(" and ")".  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              \ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:
              byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..
              (press h for help or q to quit)

              It is broken into three lines here for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the less(1) manual page.  The prompt string is first evalu‐
              ated by the shell.  All double quotes, back-quotes and backslashes in the prompt must be escaped by a preceding backslash.  The prompt string may end
              in an escaped $ which may be followed by further options for less.  By default man sets the -ix8 options.

              The $MANLESS environment variable described below may be used to set a default prompt string if none is supplied on the command line.

       -7, --ascii
              When viewing a pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may not display correctly when using the latin1(7)
              device description with GNU nroff.  This option allows pure ascii manual pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1 device.  It will  not  trans‐
              late  any  latin1 text.  The following table shows the translations performed: some parts of it may only be displayed properly when using GNU nroff's
              latin1(7) device.

              Description           Octal   latin1   ascii
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────
              continuation hyphen    255      ‐        -
              bullet (middle dot)    267      •        o
              acute accent           264      ´        '
              multiplication sign    327      ×        x

              If the latin1 column displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters and this option is not necessary.  If the latin1 and ascii
              columns  are  identical,  you  are  reading  this page using this option or man did not format this page using the latin1 device description.  If the
              latin1 column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual pages with this option.

              This option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for nroff other than GNU's.

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward compatibility, encoding may be an nroff device such as ascii,  latin1,
              or utf8 as well as a true character encoding such as UTF-8.

       --no-hyphenation, --nh
              Normally,  nroff  will  automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not contain hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to lay out
              words on a line without excessive spacing.  This option disables automatic hyphenation, so words will only be hyphenated if they already contain  hy‐
              phens.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at an inappropriate point, do not use this option, but con‐
              sult the nroff documentation instead; for instance, you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at that point, or  put  "\%"
              at the start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.

       --no-justification, --nj
              Normally, nroff will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full justification, leaving justified only to the left margin,
              sometimes called "ragged-right" text.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain paragraphs, do not use this option, but consult  the  nroff
              documentation instead; for instance, you can use the ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting and filling.

       -p string, --preprocessor=string
              Specify  the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff/groff.  Not all installations will have a full set of preprocessors.  Some of the
              preprocessors and the letters used to designate them are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer  (r).   This  option  overrides  the
              $MANROFFSEQ environment variable.  zsoelim is always run as the very first preprocessor.

       -t, --troff
              Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This  option is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to be suitable for a device other than the default.  It implies -t.  Examples (pro‐
              vided with Groff-1.17) include dvi, latin1, ps, utf8, X75 and X100.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This option will cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web browser.  The choice of browser is determined by  the  op‐
              tional browser argument if one is provided, by the $BROWSER environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually lynx).  This
              option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.

       -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]
              This option displays the output of groff in a graphical window using the gxditview program.  The dpi (dots per  inch)  may  be  75,  75-12,  100,  or
              100-12,  defaulting  to  75; the -12 variants use a 12-point base font.  This option implies -T with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device respec‐
              tively.

       -Z, --ditroff
              groff will run troff and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for the chosen device.  If groff -mandoc  is  groff,  this
              option is passed to groff and will suppress the use of a post-processor.  It implies -t.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

       MANROFFOPT
              Every time man invokes the formatter (nroff, troff, or groff), it adds the contents of $MANROFFOPT to the formatter's command line.

       MANROFFSEQ
              If  $MANROFFSEQ  is  set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors to pass each manual page through.  The default preprocessor list is
              system dependent.

       MANSECT
              If $MANSECT is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and it is used to determine which manual sections to search and  in  what  order.
              The default is "1 n l 8 3 2 3posix 3pm 3perl 3am 5 4 9 6 7", unless overridden by the SECTION directive in /etc/manpath.config.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              If  $MANPAGER  or  $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its value is used as the name of the program used to display the manual page.  By
              default, pager is used, falling back to cat if pager is not found or is not executable.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).  It may
              not  use  pipes  to connect multiple commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an argument or on
              standard input.

       MANLESS
              If $MANLESS is set, its value will be used as the default prompt string for the less pager, as if it had been passed using the -r option (so any  oc‐
              currences  of  the  text  $MAN_PN will be expanded in the same way).  For example, if you want to set the prompt string unconditionally to “my prompt
              string”, set $MANLESS to ‘-Psmy prompt string’.  Using the -r option overrides this environment variable.

       BROWSER
              If $BROWSER is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a web browser for man --html.   In
              each  command, %s is replaced by a filename containing the HTML output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and %c is replaced by
              a colon (:).

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m option.

       MANOPT If $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to be in a similar format.  As all of the other man  specific  envi‐
              ronment  variables  can be expressed as command line options, and are thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is expected that they will be‐
              come obsolete.  N.B.  All spaces that should be interpreted as part of an option's argument must be escaped.

       MANWIDTH
              If $MANWIDTH is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be formatted.  If it is not set, manual pages will be format‐
              ted  with a line length appropriate to the current terminal (using the value of $COLUMNS, and ioctl(2) if available, or falling back to 80 characters
              if neither is available).  Cat pages will only be saved when the default formatting can be used, that is when the terminal line length is between  66
              and 80 characters.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              Normally,  when  output  is  not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are discarded to make it easier to
              read the result without special tools.  However, if $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING is set to any non-empty value, these  formatting  characters  are  retained.
              This may be useful for wrappers around man that can interpret formatting characters.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              Normally,  when  output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a pager), any error output from the command used to produce formatted versions of
              manual pages is discarded to avoid interfering with the pager's display.  Programs such as groff often produce relatively minor error messages  about
              typographical  problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and generally confusing when displayed along with the manual page.  However, some
              users want to see them anyway, so, if $MAN_KEEP_STDERR is set to any non-empty value, error output will be displayed as usual.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              Depending on system and implementation, either or both of $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated for the current message locale.  man will  dis‐
              play its messages in that locale (if available).  See setlocale(3) for precise details.
